100598|01-000001|during a portion of the first half of the present century, and more particularly during the latter part of it, there flourished and practised in the city of New York a physician who enjoyed perhaps an exceptional share of the consideration which, in the United States, has always been bestowed upon distinguished members of the medical profession.|djʊəɹɪŋ eɪ pɔːʃən ɒv ðə fɜːst hɑːf ɒv ðə pɹɛzənt sɛntʃəɹi, and mɔː pətɪkjʊləli djʊəɹɪŋ ðə latə pɑːt ɒv ɪt, ðeə flʌɹɪʃt and pɹaktɪst ɪn ðə sɪti ɒv njuː jɔːk eɪ fɪzɪʃən huː ɛndʒɔɪd pəhaps an ɛksɛpʃənəl ʃeə ɒv ðə kənsɪdəɹeɪʃən wɪtʃ, ɪn ðə juːnaɪtɪd steɪts, haz ɔːlweɪz biːn bɪstəʊd əpɒn dɪstɪŋɡwɪʃt mɛmbəz ɒv ðə mɛdɪkəl pɹəfɛʃən.
100599|01-000002|This profession in America has constantly been held in honour, and more successfully than elsewhere has put forward a claim to the epithet of "liberal."|ðɪs pɹəfɛʃən ɪn ɐmɛɹɪkə haz kɒnstəntli biːn hɛld ɪn ɒnə, and mɔː səksɛsfəli ðɐn ɛlsweə haz pʊt fɔːwəd eɪ kleɪm tuː ðə ɛpɪθɪt ɒv "lɪbəɹəl."
100600|01-000003|In a country in which, to play a social part, you must either earn your income or make believe that you earn it, the healing art has appeared in a high degree to combine two recognised sources of credit.|ɪn eɪ kʌntɹi ɪn wɪtʃ, tuː pleɪ eɪ səʊʃəl pɑːt, juː mʌst aɪðə ɜːn jɔː ɪŋkʌm ɔː meɪk bɪliːv ðat juː ɜːn ɪt, ðə hiːlɪŋ ɑːt haz ɐpiəd ɪn eɪ haɪ dɪɡɹiː tuː kəmbaɪn tuː ɹɛkəɡnaɪzd sɔːsɪz ɒv kɹɛdɪt.

100602|01-000005|and it is touched by the light of science -- a merit appreciated in a community in which the love of knowledge has not always been accompanied by leisure and opportunity.|and ɪt ɪz tʌtʃt baɪ ðə laɪt ɒv saɪəns -- eɪ mɛɹɪt ɐpɹiːʃɪeɪtɪd ɪn eɪ kəmjuːnɪti ɪn wɪtʃ ðə lʌv ɒv nɒlɪdʒ haz nɒt ɔːlweɪz biːn ɐkʌmpənid baɪ lɛʒə and ɒpətjuːnɪti.
100603|01-000006|It was an element in doctor Sloper's reputation that his learning and his skill were very evenly balanced;|ɪt wɒz an ɛlɪmənt ɪn dɒktə sləʊpəz ɹɛpjuːteɪʃən ðat hɪz lɜːnɪŋ and hɪz skɪl wɜː vɛɹi iːvənli balənst;
100604|01-000007|he was what you might call a scholarly doctor, and yet there was nothing abstract in his remedies -- he always ordered you to take something.|hiː wɒz wɒt juː maɪt kɔːl eɪ skɒləli dɒktə, and jɛt ðeə wɒz nʌθɪŋ abstɹakt ɪn hɪz ɹɛmədiz -- hiː ɔːlweɪz ɔːdəd juː tuː teɪk sʌmθɪŋ.
100606|01-000009|There were some doctors that left the prescription without offering any explanation at all;|ðeə wɜː sʌm dɒktəz ðat lɛft ðə pɹɪskɹɪpʃən wɪðaʊt ɒfəɹɪŋ ɛni ɛksplɐneɪʃən at ɔːl;
100607|01-000010|and he did not belong to that class either, which was, after all, the most vulgar.|and hiː dɪd nɒt bɪlɒŋ tuː ðat klas aɪðə, wɪtʃ wɒz, aftə ɔːl, ðə məʊst vʌlɡə.
100608|01-000011|It will be seen that I am describing a clever man;|ɪt wɪl biː siːn ðat aɪ am dɪskɹaɪbɪŋ eɪ klɛvə man;
100609|01-000012|and this is really the reason why doctor Sloper had become a local celebrity.|and ðɪs ɪz ɹiəlɪ ðə ɹiːzən waɪ dɒktə sləʊpə had bɪkʌm eɪ ləʊkəl səlɛbɹɪti.
100610|01-000013|At the time at which we are chiefly concerned with him, he was some fifty years of age, and his popularity was at its height.|at ðə taɪm at wɪtʃ wiː ɑː tʃiːfli kənsɜːnd wɪð hɪm, hiː wɒz sʌm fɪfti jiəz ɒv eɪdʒ, and hɪz pɒpjʊlaɹɪti wɒz at ɪts haɪt.
100611|01-000014|He was very witty, and he passed in the best society of New York for a man of the world -- which, indeed, he was, in a very sufficient degree.|hiː wɒz vɛɹi wɪti, and hiː past ɪn ðə bɛst səsaɪəti ɒv njuː jɔːk fɔː eɪ man ɒv ðə wɜːld -- wɪtʃ, ɪndiːd, hiː wɒz, ɪn eɪ vɛɹi səfɪʃənt dɪɡɹiː.
100612|01-000015|I hasten to add, to anticipate possible misconception, that he was not the least of a charlatan.|aɪ heɪsən tuː ad, tuː antɪsɪpeɪt pɒsɪbəl mɪskənsɛpʃən, ðat hiː wɒz nɒt ðə liːst ɒv eɪ ʃɑːlətən.
100613|01-000016|He was a thoroughly honest man -- honest in a degree of which he had perhaps lacked the opportunity to give the complete measure;|hiː wɒz eɪ θʌɹəli ɒnɪst man -- ɒnɪst ɪn eɪ dɪɡɹiː ɒv wɪtʃ hiː had pəhaps lakt ðə ɒpətjuːnɪti tuː ɡɪv ðə kəmpliːt mɛʒə;
100614|01-000017|and, putting aside the great good-nature of the circle in which he practised, which was rather fond of boasting that it possessed the "brightest" doctor in the country, he daily justified his claim to the talents attributed to him by the popular voice.|and, pʊtɪŋ ɐsaɪd ðə ɡɹeɪt ɡʊdnətʃə ɒv ðə sɜːkəl ɪn wɪtʃ hiː pɹaktɪst, wɪtʃ wɒz ɹɑːðə fɒnd ɒv bəʊstɪŋ ðat ɪt pəzɛst ðə "bɹaɪtɪst" dɒktə ɪn ðə kʌntɹi, hiː deɪli dʒʌstɪfaɪd hɪz kleɪm tuː ðə talənts ɐtɹɪbjuːtɪd tuː hɪm baɪ ðə pɒpjʊlə vɔɪs.
100615|01-000018|He was an observer, even a philosopher, and to be bright was so natural to him, and (as the popular voice said) came so easily, that he never aimed at mere effect, and had none of the little tricks and pretensions of second-rate reputations.|hiː wɒz an ɒbzɜːvə, iːvən eɪ fɪlɒsəfə, and tuː biː bɹaɪt wɒz səʊ natʃəɹəl tuː hɪm, and (az ðə pɒpjʊlə vɔɪs sɛd) keɪm səʊ iːzili, ðat hiː nɛvə eɪmd at miə ɪfɛkt, and had nʌn ɒv ðə lɪtəl tɹɪks and pɹɪtɛnʃənz ɒv sɛkəndɹeɪt ɹɛpjuːteɪʃənz.
100616|01-000019|It must be confessed that fortune had favoured him, and that he had found the path to prosperity very soft to his tread.|ɪt mʌst biː kənfɛst ðat fɔːtʃuːn had feɪvəd hɪm, and ðat hiː had faʊnd ðə paθ tuː pɹəspɛɹɪti vɛɹi sɒft tuː hɪz tɹɛd.
100617|01-000020|He had married at the age of twenty-seven, for love, a very charming girl, Miss Catherine Harrington, of New York, who, in addition to her charms, had brought him a solid dowry.|hiː had maɹid at ðə eɪdʒ ɒv twɛntɪsɛvən, fɔː lʌv, eɪ vɛɹi tʃɑːmɪŋ ɡɜːl, mɪs kaθɹɪn haɹɪŋtən, ɒv njuː jɔːk, huː, ɪn ɐdɪʃən tuː hɜː tʃɑːmz, had bɹɔːt hɪm eɪ sɒlɪd daʊɹi.
100618|01-000021|misess Sloper was amiable, graceful, accomplished, elegant, and in eighteen twenty she had been one of the pretty girls of the small but promising capital which clustered about the Battery and overlooked the Bay, and of which the uppermost boundary was indicated by the grassy waysides of Canal Street.|mɪsɛs sləʊpə wɒz eɪmiəbəl, ɡɹeɪsfəl, ɐkɒmplɪʃt, ɛlɪɡənt, and ɪn eɪtiːn twɛnti ʃiː had biːn wɒn ɒv ðə pɹɪti ɡɜːlz ɒv ðə smɔːl bʌt pɹɒmɪsɪŋ kapɪtəl wɪtʃ klʌstəd ɐbaʊt ðə batəɹi and əʊvəlʊkt ðə beɪ, and ɒv wɪtʃ ðə ʌpəməʊst baʊndəɹi wɒz ɪndɪkeɪtɪd baɪ ðə ɡɹasi weɪsaɪdz ɒv kənal stɹiːt.
100619|01-000022|Even at the age of twenty-seven Austin Sloper had made his mark sufficiently to mitigate the anomaly of his having been chosen among a dozen suitors by a young woman of high fashion, who had ten thousand dollars of income and the most charming eyes in the island of Manhattan.|iːvən at ðə eɪdʒ ɒv twɛntɪsɛvən ɔːstɪn sləʊpə had meɪd hɪz mɑːk səfɪʃəntli tuː mɪtɪɡeɪt ðə ɐnɒməli ɒv hɪz havɪŋ biːn tʃəʊzən ɐmʌŋ eɪ dʌzən suːtəz baɪ eɪ jʌŋ wʊmən ɒv haɪ faʃən, huː had tɛn θaʊzənd dɒləz ɒv ɪŋkʌm and ðə məʊst tʃɑːmɪŋ aɪz ɪn ðə aɪlənd ɒv manhatən.
100620|01-000023|These eyes, and some of their accompaniments, were for about five years a source of extreme satisfaction to the young physician, who was both a devoted and a very happy husband.|ðiːz aɪz, and sʌm ɒv ðeə ɐkʌmpɐnɪmənts, wɜː fɔː ɐbaʊt faɪv jiəz eɪ sɔːs ɒv ɛkstɹiːm satɪsfakʃən tuː ðə jʌŋ fɪzɪʃən, huː wɒz bəʊθ eɪ dɪvəʊtɪd and eɪ vɛɹi hapi hʌsbənd.
100621|01-000024|The fact of his having married a rich woman made no difference in the line he had traced for himself, and he cultivated his profession with as definite a purpose as if he still had no other resources than his fraction of the modest patrimony which on his father's death he had shared with his brothers and sisters.|ðə fakt ɒv hɪz havɪŋ maɹid eɪ ɹɪtʃ wʊmən meɪd nəʊ dɪfɹəns ɪn ðə laɪn hiː had tɹeɪst fɔː hɪmsɛlf, and hiː kʌltɪveɪtɪd hɪz pɹəfɛʃən wɪð az dɛfɪnət eɪ pɜːpəs az ɪf hiː stɪl had nəʊ ʌðə ɹɪzɔːsɪz ðɐn hɪz fɹakʃən ɒv ðə mɒdɪst patɹɪməni wɪtʃ ɒn hɪz fɑːðəz dɛθ hiː had ʃeəd wɪð hɪz bɹʌðəz and sɪstəz.
100622|01-000025|This purpose had not been preponderantly to make money -- it had been rather to learn something and to do something.|ðɪs pɜːpəs had nɒt biːn pɹɪpɒndəɹəntli tuː meɪk mʌni -- ɪt had biːn ɹɑːðə tuː lɜːn sʌmθɪŋ and tuː duː sʌmθɪŋ.
100623|01-000026|To learn something interesting, and to do something useful -- this was, roughly speaking, the programme he had sketched, and of which the accident of his wife having an income appeared to him in no degree to modify the validity.|tuː lɜːn sʌmθɪŋ ɪntɹɪstɪŋ, and tuː duː sʌmθɪŋ juːsfəl -- ðɪs wɒz, ɹʌfli spiːkɪŋ, ðə pɹəʊɡɹam hiː had skɛtʃt, and ɒv wɪtʃ ðə aksɪdənt ɒv hɪz waɪf havɪŋ an ɪŋkʌm ɐpiəd tuː hɪm ɪn nəʊ dɪɡɹiː tuː mɒdɪfaɪ ðə valɪdɪti.
100625|01-000028|Of course his easy domestic situation saved him a good deal of drudgery, and his wife's affiliation to the "best people" brought him a good many of those patients whose symptoms are, if not more interesting in themselves than those of the lower orders, at least more consistently displayed.|ɒv kɔːs hɪz iːzi dəmɛstɪk sɪtʃuːeɪʃən seɪvd hɪm eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv dɹʌdʒɹi, and hɪz waɪfs ɐfɪlɪeɪʃən tuː ðə "bɛst piːpəl" bɹɔːt hɪm eɪ ɡʊd mɛni ɒv ðəʊz peɪʃənts huːz sɪmptəmz ɑː, ɪf nɒt mɔː ɪntɹɪstɪŋ ɪn ðɛmsɛlvz ðɐn ðəʊz ɒv ðə ləʊə ɔːdəz, at liːst mɔː kənsɪstəntli dɪspleɪd.

100627|01-000030|It must be added that it came to him in some forms which, whatever might have been their intrinsic value, made it the reverse of welcome.|ɪt mʌst biː adɪd ðat ɪt keɪm tuː hɪm ɪn sʌm fɔːmz wɪtʃ, wɒtɛvə maɪt hav biːn ðeə ɪntɹɪnsɪk valjuː, meɪd ɪt ðə ɹɪvɜːs ɒv wɛlkʌm.
100628|01-000031|His first child, a little boy of extraordinary promise, as the Doctor, who was not addicted to easy enthusiasms, firmly believed, died at three years of age, in spite of everything that the mother's tenderness and the father's science could invent to save him.|hɪz fɜːst tʃaɪld, eɪ lɪtəl bɔɪ ɒv ɛkstɹɔːdɪnəɹi pɹɒmɪs, az ðə dɒktə, huː wɒz nɒt ɐdɪktɪd tuː iːzi ɛnθjuːziazəmz, fɜːmli bɪliːvd, daɪd at θɹiː jiəz ɒv eɪdʒ, ɪn spaɪt ɒv ɛvɹɪθɪŋ ðat ðə mʌðəz tɛndənəs and ðə fɑːðəz saɪəns kʊd ɪnvɛnt tuː seɪv hɪm.
100629|01-000032|Two years later misess Sloper gave birth to a second infant -- an infant of a sex which rendered the poor child, to the Doctor's sense, an inadequate substitute for his lamented first-born, of whom he had promised himself to make an admirable man.|tuː jiəz leɪtə mɪsɛs sləʊpə ɡeɪv bɜːθ tuː eɪ sɛkənd ɪnfənt -- an ɪnfənt ɒv eɪ sɛks wɪtʃ ɹɛndəd ðə pʊə tʃaɪld, tuː ðə dɒktəz sɛns, an ɪnadɪkwət sʌbstɪtjuːt fɔː hɪz lɐmɛntɪd fɜːstbɔːn, ɒv huːm hiː had pɹɒmɪst hɪmsɛlf tuː meɪk an admɪɹəbəl man.
100630|01-000033|The little girl was a disappointment;|ðə lɪtəl ɡɜːl wɒz eɪ dɪsɐpɔɪntmənt;
100631|01-000034|but this was not the worst.|bʌt ðɪs wɒz nɒt ðə wɜːst.
100632|01-000035|A week after her birth the young mother, who, as the phrase is, had been doing well, suddenly betrayed alarming symptoms, and before another week had elapsed Austin Sloper was a widower.|eɪ wiːk aftə hɜː bɜːθ ðə jʌŋ mʌðə, huː, az ðə fɹeɪz ɪz, had biːn duːɪŋ wɛl, sʌdənli bɪtɹeɪd ɐlɑːmɪŋ sɪmptəmz, and bɪfɔː ɐnʌðə wiːk had ɪlapst ɔːstɪn sləʊpə wɒz eɪ wɪdəʊə.
100633|01-000036|For a man whose trade was to keep people alive, he had certainly done poorly in his own family;|fɔː eɪ man huːz tɹeɪd wɒz tuː kiːp piːpəl ɐlaɪv, hiː had sɜːtənli dʌn pʊəli ɪn hɪz əʊn famɪli;
100634|01-000037|and a bright doctor who within three years loses his wife and his little boy should perhaps be prepared to see either his skill or his affection impugned.|and eɪ bɹaɪt dɒktə huː wɪðɪn θɹiː jiəz luːzɪz hɪz waɪf and hɪz lɪtəl bɔɪ ʃʊd pəhaps biː pɹɪpeəd tuː siː aɪðə hɪz skɪl ɔː hɪz ɐfɛkʃən ɪmpjuːnd.
100635|01-000038|Our friend, however, escaped criticism: that is, he escaped all criticism but his own, which was much the most competent and most formidable.|aʊə fɹɛnd, haʊɛvə, ɛskeɪpt kɹɪtɪsɪzəm: ðat ɪz, hiː ɛskeɪpt ɔːl kɹɪtɪsɪzəm bʌt hɪz əʊn, wɪtʃ wɒz mʌtʃ ðə məʊst kɒmpɪtənt and məʊst fɔːmɪdəbəl.
100636|01-000039|He walked under the weight of this very private censure for the rest of his days, and bore for ever the scars of a castigation to which the strongest hand he knew had treated him on the night that followed his wife's death.|hiː wɔːkt ʌndə ðə weɪt ɒv ðɪs vɛɹi pɹaɪvət sɛnʃə fɔː ðə ɹɛst ɒv hɪz deɪz, and bɔː fɔː ɛvə ðə skɑːz ɒv eɪ kastɪɡeɪʃən tuː wɪtʃ ðə stɹɒŋɡɪst hand hiː njuː had tɹiːtɪd hɪm ɒn ðə naɪt ðat fɒləʊd hɪz waɪfs dɛθ.

100639|01-000042|It was observed that even medical families cannot escape the more insidious forms of disease, and that, after all, doctor Sloper had lost other patients beside the two I have mentioned;|ɪt wɒz ɒbzɜːvd ðat iːvən mɛdɪkəl famɪliz kanɒt ɛskeɪp ðə mɔː ɪnsɪdiəs fɔːmz ɒv dɪziːz, and ðat, aftə ɔːl, dɒktə sləʊpə had lɒst ʌðə peɪʃənts bɪsaɪd ðə tuː aɪ hav mɛnʃənd;

100653|02-000009|It is uncertain whether misess Penniman ever instituted a search for unfurnished lodgings, but it is beyond dispute that she never found them.|ɪt ɪz ʌnsɜːtən wɛðə mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɛvə ɪnstɪtjuːtɪd eɪ sɜːtʃ fɔː ʌnfɜːnɪʃt lɒdʒɪŋz, bʌt ɪt ɪz bɪjɒnd dɪspjuːt ðat ʃiː nɛvə faʊnd ðɛm.
100654|02-000010|She settled herself with her brother and never went away, and when Catherine was twenty years old her Aunt Lavinia was still one of the most striking features of her immediate entourage.|ʃiː sɛtəld hɜːsɛlf wɪð hɜː bɹʌðə and nɛvə wɛnt ɐweɪ, and wɛn kaθɹɪn wɒz twɛnti jiəz əʊld hɜː ant lavɪniə wɒz stɪl wɒn ɒv ðə məʊst stɹaɪkɪŋ fiːtʃəz ɒv hɜː ɪmiːdɪət ɒntʊɹɑːʒ.
100655|02-000011|misess Penniman's own account of the matter was that she had remained to take charge of her niece's education.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz əʊn ɐkaʊnt ɒv ðə matə wɒz ðat ʃiː had ɹɪmeɪnd tuː teɪk tʃɑːdʒ ɒv hɜː niːsɪz ɛdʒuːkeɪʃən.
100656|02-000012|She had given this account, at least, to every one but the Doctor, who never asked for explanations which he could entertain himself any day with inventing.|ʃiː had ɡɪvən ðɪs ɐkaʊnt, at liːst, tuː ɛvɹɪ wɒn bʌt ðə dɒktə, huː nɛvə askt fɔː ɛksplɐneɪʃənz wɪtʃ hiː kʊd ɛntəteɪn hɪmsɛlf ɛni deɪ wɪð ɪnvɛntɪŋ.
100657|02-000013|misess Penniman, moreover, though she had a good deal of a certain sort of artificial assurance, shrank, for indefinable reasons, from presenting herself to her brother as a fountain of instruction.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, mɔːɹəʊvə, ðəʊ ʃiː had eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv eɪ sɜːtən sɔːt ɒv ɑːtɪfɪʃəl əʃʊəɹəns, ʃɹaŋk, fɔː ɪndɪfaɪnəbəl ɹiːzənz, fɹɒm pɹɪzɛntɪŋ hɜːsɛlf tuː hɜː bɹʌðə az eɪ faʊntɪn ɒv ɪnstɹʌkʃən.
100658|02-000014|She had not a high sense of humour, but she had enough to prevent her from making this mistake;|ʃiː had nɒt eɪ haɪ sɛns ɒv hjuːmə, bʌt ʃiː had ɪnʌf tuː pɹɪvɛnt hɜː fɹɒm meɪkɪŋ ðɪs mɪsteɪk;
100659|02-000015|and her brother, on his side, had enough to excuse her, in her situation, for laying him under contribution during a considerable part of a lifetime.|and hɜː bɹʌðə, ɒn hɪz saɪd, had ɪnʌf tuː ɛkskjuːs hɜː, ɪn hɜː sɪtʃuːeɪʃən, fɔː leɪɪŋ hɪm ʌndə kɒntɹɪbjuːʃən djʊəɹɪŋ eɪ kənsɪdəɹəbəl pɑːt ɒv eɪ laɪftaɪm.
100660|02-000016|He therefore assented tacitly to the proposition which misess Penniman had tacitly laid down, that it was of importance that the poor motherless girl should have a brilliant woman near her.|hiː ðeəfɔː ɐsɛntɪd tasɪtli tuː ðə pɹɒpəzɪʃən wɪtʃ mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had tasɪtli leɪd daʊn, ðat ɪt wɒz ɒv ɪmpɔːtəns ðat ðə pʊə mʌðələs ɡɜːl ʃʊd hav eɪ bɹɪliənt wʊmən niə hɜː.
100661|02-000017|His assent could only be tacit, for he had never been dazzled by his sister's intellectual lustre.|hɪz ɐsɛnt kʊd əʊnli biː tasɪt, fɔː hiː had nɛvə biːn dazəld baɪ hɪz sɪstəz ɪntəlɛktʃuːəl lʌstə.
100662|02-000018|Save when he fell in love with Catherine Harrington, he had never been dazzled, indeed, by any feminine characteristics whatever;|seɪv wɛn hiː fɛl ɪn lʌv wɪð kaθɹɪn haɹɪŋtən, hiː had nɛvə biːn dazəld, ɪndiːd, baɪ ɛni fɛmənɪn kaɹɪktəɹɪstɪks wɒtɛvə;
100663|02-000019|and though he was to a certain extent what is called a ladies' doctor, his private opinion of the more complicated sex was not exalted.|and ðəʊ hiː wɒz tuː eɪ sɜːtən ɛkstɛnt wɒt ɪz kɔːld eɪ leɪdiz dɒktə, hɪz pɹaɪvət əpɪniən ɒv ðə mɔː kɒmplɪkeɪtɪd sɛks wɒz nɒt ɛɡzɒltɪd.
100664|02-000020|He regarded its complications as more curious than edifying, and he had an idea of the beauty of reason, which was, on the whole, meagrely gratified by what he observed in his female patients.|hiː ɹɪɡɑːdɪd ɪts kɒmplɪkeɪʃənz az mɔː kjʊəɹiəs ðɐn ɛdɪfaɪɪŋ, and hiː had an aɪdiə ɒv ðə bjuːti ɒv ɹiːzən, wɪtʃ wɒz, ɒn ðə həʊl, miːɡəli ɡɹatɪfaɪd baɪ wɒt hiː ɒbzɜːvd ɪn hɪz fiːmeɪl peɪʃənts.
100665|02-000021|His wife had been a reasonable woman, but she was a bright exception;|hɪz waɪf had biːn eɪ ɹiːzənəbəl wʊmən, bʌt ʃiː wɒz eɪ bɹaɪt ɛksɛpʃən;
100666|02-000022|among several things that he was sure of, this was perhaps the principal.|ɐmʌŋ sɛvɹəl θɪŋz ðat hiː wɒz ʃʊə ɒv, ðɪs wɒz pəhaps ðə pɹɪnsɪpəl.
100667|02-000023|Such a conviction, of course, did little either to mitigate or to abbreviate his widowhood;|sʌtʃ eɪ kənvɪkʃən, ɒv kɔːs, dɪd lɪtəl aɪðə tuː mɪtɪɡeɪt ɔː tuː ɐbɹiːvɪeɪt hɪz wɪdəʊhʊd;
100668|02-000024|and it set a limit to his recognition, at the best, of Catherine's possibilities and of misess Penniman's ministrations.|and ɪt sɛt eɪ lɪmɪt tuː hɪz ɹɛkəɡnɪʃən, at ðə bɛst, ɒv kaθɹɪnz pɒsəbɪlɪtiz and ɒv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz mɪnɪstɹeɪʃənz.
100669|02-000025|He, nevertheless, at the end of six months, accepted his sister's permanent presence as an accomplished fact, and as Catherine grew older perceived that there were in effect good reasons why she should have a companion of her own imperfect sex.|hiː, nɛvəðəlɛs, at ðə ɛnd ɒv sɪks mʌnθs, ɐksɛptɪd hɪz sɪstəz pɜːmənənt pɹɛzəns az an ɐkɒmplɪʃt fakt, and az kaθɹɪn ɡɹuː əʊldə pəsiːvd ðat ðeə wɜː ɪn ɪfɛkt ɡʊd ɹiːzənz waɪ ʃiː ʃʊd hav eɪ kəmpaniən ɒv hɜː əʊn ɪmpɜːfɛkt sɛks.
100670|02-000026|He was extremely polite to Lavinia, scrupulously, formally polite;|hiː wɒz ɛkstɹiːmli pəlaɪt tuː lavɪniə, skɹuːpjʊləsli, fɔːməli pəlaɪt;
100671|02-000027|and she had never seen him in anger but once in her life, when he lost his temper in a theological discussion with her late husband.|and ʃiː had nɛvə siːn hɪm ɪn aŋɡə bʌt wʌns ɪn hɜː laɪf, wɛn hiː lɒst hɪz tɛmpə ɪn eɪ θiːəlɒdʒɪkəl dɪskʌʃən wɪð hɜː leɪt hʌsbənd.
100672|02-000028|With her he never discussed theology, nor, indeed, discussed anything;|wɪð hɜː hiː nɛvə dɪskʌst θɪɒlədʒi, nɔː, ɪndiːd, dɪskʌst ɛnɪθɪŋ;
100673|02-000029|he contented himself with making known, very distinctly, in the form of a lucid ultimatum, his wishes with regard to Catherine.|hiː kəntɛntɪd hɪmsɛlf wɪð meɪkɪŋ nəʊn, vɛɹi dɪstɪŋktli, ɪn ðə fɔːm ɒv eɪ luːsɪd ʌltɪmeɪtəm, hɪz wɪʃɪz wɪð ɹɪɡɑːd tuː kaθɹɪn.
100674|02-000030|Once, when the girl was about twelve years old, he had said to her:|wʌns, wɛn ðə ɡɜːl wɒz ɐbaʊt twɛlv jiəz əʊld, hiː had sɛd tuː hɜː:

100677|02-000033|misess Penniman, at this, looked thoughtful a moment.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, at ðɪs, lʊkt θɔːtfəl eɪ məʊmənt.
100678|02-000034|"My dear Austin," she then inquired, "do you think it is better to be clever than to be good?"| "maɪ diə ɔːstɪn," ʃiː ðɛn ɪŋkwaɪəd, "duː juː θɪŋk ɪt ɪz bɛtə tuː biː klɛvə ðɐn tuː biː ɡʊd?"
100679|02-000035|"Good for what?" asked the Doctor.| "ɡʊd fɔː wɒt?" askt ðə dɒktə.

100681|02-000037|From this assertion misess Penniman saw no reason to dissent;|fɹɒm ðɪs ɐsɜːʃən mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən sɔː nəʊ ɹiːzən tuː dɪsɛnt;
100682|02-000038|she possibly reflected that her own great use in the world was owing to her aptitude for many things.|ʃiː pɒsɪbli ɹɪflɛktɪd ðat hɜː əʊn ɡɹeɪt juːs ɪn ðə wɜːld wɒz əʊɪŋ tuː hɜː aptɪtjuːd fɔː mɛni θɪŋz.
100683|02-000039|"Of course I wish Catherine to be good," the Doctor said next day;| "ɒv kɔːs aɪ wɪʃ kaθɹɪn tuː biː ɡʊd," ðə dɒktə sɛd nɛkst deɪ;
100684|02-000040|but she won't be any the less virtuous for not being a fool.|bʌt ʃiː wɒnt biː ɛni ðə lɛs vɜːtʃuːəs fɔː nɒt biːɪŋ eɪ fuːl.
100685|02-000041|I am not afraid of her being wicked;|aɪ am nɒt ɐfɹeɪd ɒv hɜː biːɪŋ wɪkɪd;
100686|02-000042|she will never have the salt of malice in her character.|ʃiː wɪl nɛvə hav ðə sɒlt ɒv malɪs ɪn hɜː kaɹɪktə.

100691|02-000047|"so you needn't fear!" said misess Penniman, who had taken in hand the child's accomplishments, overlooking her at the piano, where Catherine displayed a certain talent, and going with her to the dancing-class, where it must be confessed that she made but a modest figure.| "səʊ juː niːdnt fiə!" sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː had teɪkən ɪn hand ðə tʃaɪldz ɐkɒmplɪʃmənts, əʊvəlʊkɪŋ hɜː at ðə pianəʊ, weə kaθɹɪn dɪspleɪd eɪ sɜːtən talənt, and ɡəʊɪŋ wɪð hɜː tuː ðə dansɪŋklas, weə ɪt mʌst biː kənfɛst ðat ʃiː meɪd bʌt eɪ mɒdɪst fɪɡə.

100698|02-000054|misess Penniman had never had a lover, but her brother, who was very shrewd, understood her turn of mind.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had nɛvə had eɪ lʌvə, bʌt hɜː bɹʌðə, huː wɒz vɛɹi ʃɹuːd, ʌndəstʊd hɜː tɜːn ɒv maɪnd.
100699|02-000055|"When Catherine is about seventeen," he said to himself, "Lavinia will try and persuade her that some young man with a moustache is in love with her."| "wɛn kaθɹɪn ɪz ɐbaʊt sɛvəntiːn," hiː sɛd tuː hɪmsɛlf, "lavɪniə wɪl tɹaɪ and pəsweɪd hɜː ðat sʌm jʌŋ man wɪð eɪ məstaʃ ɪz ɪn lʌv wɪð hɜː."

100730|02-000086|doctor Sloper would have liked to be proud of his daughter;|dɒktə sləʊpə wʊd hav laɪkt tuː biː pɹaʊd ɒv hɪz dɔːtə;
100731|02-000087|but there was nothing to be proud of in poor Catherine.|bʌt ðeə wɒz nʌθɪŋ tuː biː pɹaʊd ɒv ɪn pʊə kaθɹɪn.
100732|02-000088|There was nothing, of course, to be ashamed of;|ðeə wɒz nʌθɪŋ, ɒv kɔːs, tuː biː ɐʃeɪmd ɒv;
100733|02-000089|but this was not enough for the Doctor, who was a proud man and would have enjoyed being able to think of his daughter as an unusual girl.|bʌt ðɪs wɒz nɒt ɪnʌf fɔː ðə dɒktə, huː wɒz eɪ pɹaʊd man and wʊd hav ɛndʒɔɪd biːɪŋ eɪbəl tuː θɪŋk ɒv hɪz dɔːtə az an ʌnjuːʒuːəl ɡɜːl.
100734|02-000090|There would have been a fitness in her being pretty and graceful, intelligent and distinguished;|ðeə wʊd hav biːn eɪ fɪtnəs ɪn hɜː biːɪŋ pɹɪti and ɡɹeɪsfəl, ɪntɛlɪdʒənt and dɪstɪŋɡwɪʃt;
100735|02-000091|for her mother had been the most charming woman of her little day, and as regards her father, of course he knew his own value.|fɔː hɜː mʌðə had biːn ðə məʊst tʃɑːmɪŋ wʊmən ɒv hɜː lɪtəl deɪ, and az ɹɪɡɑːdz hɜː fɑːðə, ɒv kɔːs hiː njuː hɪz əʊn valjuː.
100736|02-000092|He had moments of irritation at having produced a commonplace child, and he even went so far at times as to take a certain satisfaction in the thought that his wife had not lived to find her out.|hiː had məʊmənts ɒv ɪɹɪteɪʃən at havɪŋ pɹədjuːst eɪ kɒmənpleɪs tʃaɪld, and hiː iːvən wɛnt səʊ fɑː at taɪmz az tuː teɪk eɪ sɜːtən satɪsfakʃən ɪn ðə θɔːt ðat hɪz waɪf had nɒt lɪvd tuː faɪnd hɜː aʊt.
100737|02-000093|He was naturally slow in making this discovery himself, and it was not till Catherine had become a young lady grown that he regarded the matter as settled.|hiː wɒz natʃəɹəli sləʊ ɪn meɪkɪŋ ðɪs dɪskʌvəɹi hɪmsɛlf, and ɪt wɒz nɒt tɪl kaθɹɪn had bɪkʌm eɪ jʌŋ leɪdi ɡɹəʊn ðat hiː ɹɪɡɑːdɪd ðə matə az sɛtəld.

100739|02-000095|he was in no haste to conclude.|hiː wɒz ɪn nəʊ heɪst tuː kəŋkluːd.
100740|02-000096|misess Penniman frequently assured him that his daughter had a delightful nature;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən fɹiːkwəntli əʃʊəd hɪm ðat hɪz dɔːtə had eɪ dɪlaɪtfəl neɪtʃə;
100741|02-000097|but he knew how to interpret this assurance.|bʌt hiː njuː haʊ tuː ɪntɜːpɹɪt ðɪs əʃʊəɹəns.
100742|02-000098|It meant, to his sense, that Catherine was not wise enough to discover that her aunt was a goose -- a limitation of mind that could not fail to be agreeable to misess Penniman.|ɪt mɛnt, tuː hɪz sɛns, ðat kaθɹɪn wɒz nɒt waɪz ɪnʌf tuː dɪskʌvə ðat hɜː ant wɒz eɪ ɡuːs -- eɪ lɪmɪteɪʃən ɒv maɪnd ðat kʊd nɒt feɪl tuː biː ɐɡɹiːəbəl tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
100743|02-000099|Both she and her brother, however, exaggerated the young girl's limitations;|bəʊθ ʃiː and hɜː bɹʌðə, haʊɛvə, ɛɡzadʒəɹeɪtɪd ðə jʌŋ ɡɜːlz lɪmɪteɪʃənz;
100744|02-000100|for Catherine, though she was very fond of her aunt, and conscious of the gratitude she owed her, regarded her without a particle of that gentle dread which gave its stamp to her admiration of her father.|fɔː kaθɹɪn, ðəʊ ʃiː wɒz vɛɹi fɒnd ɒv hɜː ant, and kɒnʃəs ɒv ðə ɡɹatɪtjuːd ʃiː əʊd hɜː, ɹɪɡɑːdɪd hɜː wɪðaʊt eɪ pɑːtɪkəl ɒv ðat dʒɛntəl dɹɛd wɪtʃ ɡeɪv ɪts stamp tuː hɜː adməɹeɪʃən ɒv hɜː fɑːðə.
100745|02-000101|To her mind there was nothing of the infinite about misess Penniman;|tuː hɜː maɪnd ðeə wɒz nʌθɪŋ ɒv ðə ɪnfɪnət ɐbaʊt mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən;
100746|02-000102|Catherine saw her all at once, as it were, and was not dazzled by the apparition;|kaθɹɪn sɔː hɜː ɔːl at wʌns, az ɪt wɜː, and wɒz nɒt dazəld baɪ ðə apəɹɪʃən;
100747|02-000103|whereas her father's great faculties seemed, as they stretched away, to lose themselves in a sort of luminous vagueness, which indicated, not that they stopped, but that Catherine's own mind ceased to follow them.|weəɹaz hɜː fɑːðəz ɡɹeɪt fakəltiz siːmd, az ðeɪ stɹɛtʃt ɐweɪ, tuː luːz ðɛmsɛlvz ɪn eɪ sɔːt ɒv luːmɪnəs veɪɡnəs, wɪtʃ ɪndɪkeɪtɪd, nɒt ðat ðeɪ stɒpt, bʌt ðat kaθɹɪnz əʊn maɪnd siːst tuː fɒləʊ ðɛm.
100748|02-000104|It must not be supposed that doctor Sloper visited his disappointment upon the poor girl, or ever let her suspect that she had played him a trick.|ɪt mʌst nɒt biː səpəʊzd ðat dɒktə sləʊpə vɪzɪtɪd hɪz dɪsɐpɔɪntmənt əpɒn ðə pʊə ɡɜːl, ɔː ɛvə lɛt hɜː sʌspɛkt ðat ʃiː had pleɪd hɪm eɪ tɹɪk.
100749|02-000105|On the contrary, for fear of being unjust to her, he did his duty with exemplary zeal, and recognised that she was a faithful and affectionate child.|ɒn ðə kɒntɹəɹi, fɔː fiə ɒv biːɪŋ ʌndʒʌst tuː hɜː, hiː dɪd hɪz djuːti wɪð ɛɡzɛmpləɹi ziːl, and ɹɛkəɡnaɪzd ðat ʃiː wɒz eɪ feɪθfəl and ɐfɛkʃənət tʃaɪld.
100750|02-000106|Besides, he was a philosopher;|bɪsaɪdz, hiː wɒz eɪ fɪlɒsəfə;
100751|02-000107|he smoked a good many cigars over his disappointment, and in the fulness of time he got used to it.|hiː sməʊkt eɪ ɡʊd mɛni sɪɡɑːz əʊvə hɪz dɪsɐpɔɪntmənt, and ɪn ðə fʌlnəs ɒv taɪm hiː ɡɒt juːzd tuː ɪt.
100752|02-000108|He satisfied himself that he had expected nothing, though, indeed, with a certain oddity of reasoning.|hiː satɪsfaɪd hɪmsɛlf ðat hiː had ɛkspɛktɪd nʌθɪŋ, ðəʊ, ɪndiːd, wɪð eɪ sɜːtən ɒdɪti ɒv ɹiːzənɪŋ.
100754|02-000110|If she doesn't, it will be no loss.|ɪf ʃiː dʌzənt, ɪt wɪl biː nəʊ lɒs.
100755|02-000111|This was about the time Catherine had reached her eighteenth year, so that it will be seen her father had not been precipitate.|ðɪs wɒz ɐbaʊt ðə taɪm kaθɹɪn had ɹiːtʃt hɜː eɪtiːnθ jiə, səʊ ðat ɪt wɪl biː siːn hɜː fɑːðə had nɒt biːn pɹɪsɪpɪteɪt.
100756|02-000112|At this time she seemed not only incapable of giving surprises;|at ðɪs taɪm ʃiː siːmd nɒt əʊnli ɪŋkeɪpəbəl ɒv ɡɪvɪŋ səpɹaɪzɪz;
100757|02-000113|it was almost a question whether she could have received one -- she was so quiet and irresponsive.|ɪt wɒz ɔːlməʊst eɪ kwɛstʃən wɛðə ʃiː kʊd hav ɹɪsiːvd wɒn -- ʃiː wɒz səʊ kwaɪət and ɪɹɪspɒnsɪv.
100758|02-000114|People who expressed themselves roughly called her stolid.|piːpəl huː ɛkspɹɛst ðɛmsɛlvz ɹʌfli kɔːld hɜː stɒlɪd.
100759|02-000115|But she was irresponsive because she was shy, uncomfortably, painfully shy.|bʌt ʃiː wɒz ɪɹɪspɒnsɪv bɪkɒz ʃiː wɒz ʃaɪ, ʌŋkʌmftəbli, peɪnfəli ʃaɪ.
100760|02-000116|This was not always understood, and she sometimes produced an impression of insensibility.|ðɪs wɒz nɒt ɔːlweɪz ʌndəstʊd, and ʃiː sʌmtaɪmz pɹədjuːst an ɪmpɹɛʃən ɒv ɪnsɛnsəbɪlɪti.
100762|03-000002|She was strong, however, and properly made, and, fortunately, her health was excellent.|ʃiː wɒz stɹɒŋ, haʊɛvə, and pɹɒpəli meɪd, and, fɔːtʃənətli, hɜː hɛlθ wɒz ɛksələnt.
100763|03-000003|It has been noted that the Doctor was a philosopher, but I would not have answered for his philosophy if the poor girl had proved a sickly and suffering person.|ɪt haz biːn nəʊtɪd ðat ðə dɒktə wɒz eɪ fɪlɒsəfə, bʌt aɪ wʊd nɒt hav ansəd fɔː hɪz fɪlɒsəfi ɪf ðə pʊə ɡɜːl had pɹuːvd eɪ sɪkli and sʌfəɹɪŋ pɜːsən.
100764|03-000004|Her appearance of health constituted her principal claim to beauty, and her clear, fresh complexion, in which white and red were very equally distributed, was, indeed, an excellent thing to see.|hɜː ɐpiəɹəns ɒv hɛlθ kɒnstɪtjuːtɪd hɜː pɹɪnsɪpəl kleɪm tuː bjuːti, and hɜː kliə, fɹɛʃ kəmplɛkʃən, ɪn wɪtʃ waɪt and ɹɛd wɜː vɛɹi iːkwəli dɪstɹɪbjuːtɪd, wɒz, ɪndiːd, an ɛksələnt θɪŋ tuː siː.
100765|03-000005|Her eye was small and quiet, her features were rather thick, her tresses brown and smooth.|hɜː aɪ wɒz smɔːl and kwaɪət, hɜː fiːtʃəz wɜː ɹɑːðə θɪk, hɜː tɹɛsɪz bɹaʊn and smuːð.
100766|03-000006|A dull, plain girl she was called by rigorous critics -- a quiet, ladylike girl by those of the more imaginative sort;|eɪ dʌl, pleɪn ɡɜːl ʃiː wɒz kɔːld baɪ ɹɪɡəɹəs kɹɪtɪks -- eɪ kwaɪət, leɪdilaɪk ɡɜːl baɪ ðəʊz ɒv ðə mɔː ɪmadʒɪnətɪv sɔːt;
100767|03-000007|but by neither class was she very elaborately discussed.|bʌt baɪ naɪðə klas wɒz ʃiː vɛɹi ɪlabəɹeɪtli dɪskʌst.
100768|03-000008|When it had been duly impressed upon her that she was a young lady -- it was a good while before she could believe it -- she suddenly developed a lively taste for dress: a lively taste is quite the expression to use.|wɛn ɪt had biːn djuːli ɪmpɹɛst əpɒn hɜː ðat ʃiː wɒz eɪ jʌŋ leɪdi -- ɪt wɒz eɪ ɡʊd waɪl bɪfɔː ʃiː kʊd bɪliːv ɪt -- ʃiː sʌdənli dɪvɛləpt eɪ laɪvlɪ teɪst fɔː dɹɛs: eɪ laɪvlɪ teɪst ɪz kwaɪt ðə ɛkspɹɛʃən tuː juːs.
100769|03-000009|I feel as if I ought to write it very small, her judgement in this matter was by no means infallible;|aɪ fiːl az ɪf aɪ ɔːt tuː ɹaɪt ɪt vɛɹi smɔːl, hɜː dʒʌdʒmənt ɪn ðɪs matə wɒz baɪ nəʊ miːnz ɪnfalɪbəl;
100770|03-000010|it was liable to confusions and embarrassments.|ɪt wɒz laɪəbəl tuː kənfjuːʒənz and ɛmbaɹəsmənts.
100771|03-000011|Her great indulgence of it was really the desire of a rather inarticulate nature to manifest itself;|hɜː ɡɹeɪt ɪndʌldʒəns ɒv ɪt wɒz ɹiəlɪ ðə dɪzaɪə ɒv eɪ ɹɑːðə ɪnɑːtɪkjʊleɪt neɪtʃə tuː manɪfɛst ɪtsɛlf;
100772|03-000012|she sought to be eloquent in her garments, and to make up for her diffidence of speech by a fine frankness of costume.|ʃiː sɔːt tuː biː ɛləkwənt ɪn hɜː ɡɑːmənts, and tuː meɪk ʌp fɔː hɜː dɪfɪdəns ɒv spiːtʃ baɪ eɪ faɪn fɹaŋknəs ɒv kɒstjuːm.
100774|03-000014|It must be added that though she had the expectation of a fortune -- doctor Sloper for a long time had been making twenty thousand dollars a year by his profession, and laying aside the half of it -- the amount of money at her disposal was not greater than the allowance made to many poorer girls.|ɪt mʌst biː adɪd ðat ðəʊ ʃiː had ðə ɛkspɪkteɪʃən ɒv eɪ fɔːtʃuːn -- dɒktə sləʊpə fɔː eɪ lɒŋ taɪm had biːn meɪkɪŋ twɛnti θaʊzənd dɒləz eɪ jiə baɪ hɪz pɹəfɛʃən, and leɪɪŋ ɐsaɪd ðə hɑːf ɒv ɪt -- ðə ɐmaʊnt ɒv mʌni at hɜː dɪspəʊzəl wɒz nɒt ɡɹeɪtə ðɐn ðə ɐlaʊəns meɪd tuː mɛni pʊəɹə ɡɜːlz.
100775|03-000015|In those days in New York there were still a few altar-fires flickering in the temple of Republican simplicity, and doctor Sloper would have been glad to see his daughter present herself, with a classic grace, as a priestess of this mild faith.|ɪn ðəʊz deɪz ɪn njuː jɔːk ðeə wɜː stɪl eɪ fjuː ɒltɑːfaɪəz flɪkəɹɪŋ ɪn ðə tɛmpəl ɒv ɹɪpʌblɪkən sɪmplɪsɪti, and dɒktə sləʊpə wʊd hav biːn ɡlad tuː siː hɪz dɔːtə pɹɛzənt hɜːsɛlf, wɪð eɪ klasɪk ɡɹeɪs, az eɪ pɹiːstɛs ɒv ðɪs maɪld feɪθ.
100776|03-000016|It made him fairly grimace, in private, to think that a child of his should be both ugly and overdressed.|ɪt meɪd hɪm feəli ɡɹɪmɪs, ɪn pɹaɪvət, tuː θɪŋk ðat eɪ tʃaɪld ɒv hɪz ʃʊd biː bəʊθ ʌɡli and əʊvədɹɛst.
100777|03-000017|For himself, he was fond of the good things of life, and he made a considerable use of them;|fɔː hɪmsɛlf, hiː wɒz fɒnd ɒv ðə ɡʊd θɪŋz ɒv laɪf, and hiː meɪd eɪ kənsɪdəɹəbəl juːs ɒv ðɛm;
100778|03-000018|but he had a dread of vulgarity, and even a theory that it was increasing in the society that surrounded him.|bʌt hiː had eɪ dɹɛd ɒv vʌlɡaɹɪti, and iːvən eɪ θiəɹi ðat ɪt wɒz ɪŋkɹiːsɪŋ ɪn ðə səsaɪəti ðat səɹaʊndɪd hɪm.
100779|03-000019|Moreover, the standard of luxury in the United States thirty years ago was carried by no means so high as at present, and Catherine's clever father took the old-fashioned view of the education of young persons.|mɔːɹəʊvə, ðə standəd ɒv lʌkʃəɹi ɪn ðə juːnaɪtɪd steɪts θɜːti jiəz ɐɡəʊ wɒz kaɹid baɪ nəʊ miːnz səʊ haɪ az at pɹɛzənt, and kaθɹɪnz klɛvə fɑːðə tʊk ðə əʊldfaʃənd vjuː ɒv ðə ɛdʒuːkeɪʃən ɒv jʌŋ pɜːsənz.
100780|03-000020|He had no particular theory on the subject;|hiː had nəʊ pətɪkjʊlə θiəɹi ɒn ðə sʌbdʒɛkt;
100781|03-000021|it had scarcely as yet become a necessity of self-defence to have a collection of theories.|ɪt had skeəsli az jɛt bɪkʌm eɪ nəsɛsɪti ɒv sɛlfdɪfɛns tuː hav eɪ kəlɛkʃən ɒv θiəɹiz.
100782|03-000022|It simply appeared to him proper and reasonable that a well-bred young woman should not carry half her fortune on her back.|ɪt sɪmpli ɐpiəd tuː hɪm pɹɒpə and ɹiːzənəbəl ðat eɪ wɛlbɹɛd jʌŋ wʊmən ʃʊd nɒt kaɹi hɑːf hɜː fɔːtʃuːn ɒn hɜː bak.
100783|03-000023|Catherine's back was a broad one, and would have carried a good deal;|kaθɹɪnz bak wɒz eɪ bɹɔːd wɒn, and wʊd hav kaɹid eɪ ɡʊd diːl;
100784|03-000024|but to the weight of the paternal displeasure she never ventured to expose it, and our heroine was twenty years old before she treated herself, for evening wear, to a red satin gown trimmed with gold fringe;|bʌt tuː ðə weɪt ɒv ðə pətɜːnəl dɪsplɛʒə ʃiː nɛvə vɛntʃəd tuː ɛkspəʊz ɪt, and aʊə hɛɹəʊɪn wɒz twɛnti jiəz əʊld bɪfɔː ʃiː tɹiːtɪd hɜːsɛlf, fɔː iːvnɪŋ weə, tuː eɪ ɹɛd satɪn ɡaʊn tɹɪmd wɪð ɡəʊld fɹɪndʒ;

100786|03-000026|It made her look, when she sported it, like a woman of thirty;|ɪt meɪd hɜː lʊk, wɛn ʃiː spɔːtɪd ɪt, laɪk eɪ wʊmən ɒv θɜːti;
100787|03-000027|but oddly enough, in spite of her taste for fine clothes, she had not a grain of coquetry, and her anxiety when she put them on was as to whether they, and not she, would look well.|bʌt ɒdli ɪnʌf, ɪn spaɪt ɒv hɜː teɪst fɔː faɪn kləʊðz, ʃiː had nɒt eɪ ɡɹeɪn ɒv kɒkwɪtɹi, and hɜː aŋzaɪəti wɛn ʃiː pʊt ðɛm ɒn wɒz az tuː wɛðə ðeɪ, and nɒt ʃiː, wʊd lʊk wɛl.
100788|03-000028|It is a point on which history has not been explicit, but the assumption is warrantable;|ɪt ɪz eɪ pɔɪnt ɒn wɪtʃ hɪstəɹi haz nɒt biːn ɛksplɪsɪt, bʌt ðə ɐsʌmpʃən ɪz wɒɹəntəbəl;
100789|03-000029|it was in the royal raiment just mentioned that she presented herself at a little entertainment given by her aunt, misess Almond.|ɪt wɒz ɪn ðə ɹɔɪəl ɹeɪmənt dʒʌst mɛnʃənd ðat ʃiː pɹɪzɛntɪd hɜːsɛlf at eɪ lɪtəl ɛntəteɪnmənt ɡɪvən baɪ hɜː ant, mɪsɛs ɒlmənd.
100790|03-000030|The girl was at this time in her twenty-first year, and misess Almond's party was the beginning of something very important.|ðə ɡɜːl wɒz at ðɪs taɪm ɪn hɜː twɛntɪfɜːst jiə, and mɪsɛs ɒlməndz pɑːti wɒz ðə bɪɡɪnɪŋ ɒv sʌmθɪŋ vɛɹi ɪmpɔːtənt.
100791|03-000031|Some three or four years before this doctor Sloper had moved his household gods up town, as they say in New York.|sʌm θɹiː ɔː fɔː jiəz bɪfɔː ðɪs dɒktə sləʊpə had muːvd hɪz haʊshəʊld ɡɒdz ʌp taʊn, az ðeɪ seɪ ɪn njuː jɔːk.

100809|03-000049|misess Almond lived much farther up town, in an embryonic street with a high number -- a region where the extension of the city began to assume a theoretic air, where poplars grew beside the pavement (when there was one), and mingled their shade with the steep roofs of desultory Dutch houses, and where pigs and chickens disported themselves in the gutter.|mɪsɛs ɒlmənd lɪvd mʌtʃ fɑːðə ʌp taʊn, ɪn an ɛmbɹɪɒnɪk stɹiːt wɪð eɪ haɪ nʌmbə -- eɪ ɹiːdʒən weə ðə ɛkstɛnʃən ɒv ðə sɪti bɪɡan tuː ɐsjuːm eɪ θiəɹɛtɪk eə, weə pɒpləz ɡɹuː bɪsaɪd ðə peɪvmənt (wɛn ðeə wɒz wɒn), and mɪŋɡəld ðeə ʃeɪd wɪð ðə stiːp ɹuːfs ɒv dɛsəltəɹi dʌtʃ haʊzɪz, and weə pɪɡz and tʃɪkɪnz dɪspɔːtɪd ðɛmsɛlvz ɪn ðə ɡʌtə.

100812|03-000052|Catherine had a great many cousins, and with her Aunt Almond's children, who ended by being nine in number, she lived on terms of considerable intimacy.|kaθɹɪn had eɪ ɡɹeɪt mɛni kʌzənz, and wɪð hɜː ant ɒlməndz tʃɪldɹən, huː ɛndɪd baɪ biːɪŋ naɪn ɪn nʌmbə, ʃiː lɪvd ɒn tɜːmz ɒv kənsɪdəɹəbəl ɪntɪməsi.

100814|03-000054|she was believed, as the phrase is, to be highly educated, and a person who lived in the intimacy of their Aunt Penniman had something of reflected grandeur.|ʃiː wɒz bɪliːvd, az ðə fɹeɪz ɪz, tuː biː haɪli ɛdʒuːkeɪtɪd, and eɪ pɜːsən huː lɪvd ɪn ðə ɪntɪməsi ɒv ðeə ant pɛnɪmən had sʌmθɪŋ ɒv ɹɪflɛktɪd ɡɹandjʊə.
100815|03-000055|misess Penniman, among the little Almonds, was an object of more admiration than sympathy.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, ɐmʌŋ ðə lɪtəl ɒlməndz, wɒz an ɒbdʒɛkt ɒv mɔː adməɹeɪʃən ðɐn sɪmpəθi.
100816|03-000056|Her manners were strange and formidable, and her mourning robes -- she dressed in black for twenty years after her husband's death, and then suddenly appeared one morning with pink roses in her cap -- were complicated in odd, unexpected places with buckles, bugles, and pins, which discouraged familiarity.|hɜː manəz wɜː stɹeɪndʒ and fɔːmɪdəbəl, and hɜː mɔːnɪŋ ɹəʊbz -- ʃiː dɹɛst ɪn blak fɔː twɛnti jiəz aftə hɜː hʌsbəndz dɛθ, and ðɛn sʌdənli ɐpiəd wɒn mɔːnɪŋ wɪð pɪŋk ɹəʊzɪz ɪn hɜː kap -- wɜː kɒmplɪkeɪtɪd ɪn ɒd, ʌnɛkspɛktɪd pleɪsɪz wɪð bʌkəlz, bjuːɡəlz, and pɪnz, wɪtʃ dɪskʌɹɪdʒd fəmɪliaɹɪti.
100817|03-000057|She took children too hard, both for good and for evil, and had an oppressive air of expecting subtle things of them, so that going to see her was a good deal like being taken to church and made to sit in a front pew.|ʃiː tʊk tʃɪldɹən tuː hɑːd, bəʊθ fɔː ɡʊd and fɔː iːvəl, and had an əpɹɛsɪv eə ɒv ɛkspɛktɪŋ sʌtəl θɪŋz ɒv ðɛm, səʊ ðat ɡəʊɪŋ tuː siː hɜː wɒz eɪ ɡʊd diːl laɪk biːɪŋ teɪkən tuː tʃɜːtʃ and meɪd tuː sɪt ɪn eɪ fɹʌnt pjuː.
100818|03-000058|It was discovered after a while, however, that Aunt Penniman was but an accident in Catherine's existence, and not a part of its essence, and that when the girl came to spend a Saturday with her cousins, she was available for "follow-my-master," and even for leapfrog.|ɪt wɒz dɪskʌvəd aftə eɪ waɪl, haʊɛvə, ðat ant pɛnɪmən wɒz bʌt an aksɪdənt ɪn kaθɹɪnz ɛɡzɪstəns, and nɒt eɪ pɑːt ɒv ɪts ɛsəns, and ðat wɛn ðə ɡɜːl keɪm tuː spɛnd eɪ satədeɪ wɪð hɜː kʌzənz, ʃiː wɒz ɐveɪləbəl fɔː "fɒləʊmɪmastə," and iːvən fɔː liːpfɹɒɡ.
100819|03-000059|On this basis an understanding was easily arrived at, and for several years Catherine fraternised with her young kinsmen.|ɒn ðɪs beɪsɪs an ʌndəstandɪŋ wɒz iːzili ɐɹaɪvd at, and fɔː sɛvɹəl jiəz kaθɹɪn fɹɐtɜːnaɪzd wɪð hɜː jʌŋ kɪnzmɛn.
100820|03-000060|I say young kinsmen, because seven of the little Almonds were boys, and Catherine had a preference for those games which are most conveniently played in trousers.|aɪ seɪ jʌŋ kɪnzmɛn, bɪkɒz sɛvən ɒv ðə lɪtəl ɒlməndz wɜː bɔɪz, and kaθɹɪn had eɪ pɹɛfɹəns fɔː ðəʊz ɡeɪmz wɪtʃ ɑː məʊst kənviːnɪəntli pleɪd ɪn tɹaʊsəz.

100828|04-000003|There was to be a good deal of dancing, and before it had gone very far, Marian Almond came up to Catherine, in company with a tall young man.|ðeə wɒz tuː biː eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv dansɪŋ, and bɪfɔː ɪt had ɡɒn vɛɹi fɑː, maɹiən ɒlmənd keɪm ʌp tuː kaθɹɪn, ɪn kʌmpəni wɪð eɪ tɔːl jʌŋ man.
100829|04-000004|She introduced the young man as a person who had a great desire to make our heroine's acquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur Townsend, her own intended.|ʃiː ɪntɹədjuːst ðə jʌŋ man az eɪ pɜːsən huː had eɪ ɡɹeɪt dɪzaɪə tuː meɪk aʊə hɛɹəʊɪnz ɐkweɪntəns, and az eɪ kʌzən ɒv ɑːθə taʊnsɛnd, hɜː əʊn ɪntɛndɪd.

100845|04-000020|These observations, in themselves of no great profundity, mister Townsend seemed to offer for what they were worth, and as a contribution to an acquaintance.|ðiːz ɒbzəveɪʃənz, ɪn ðɛmsɛlvz ɒv nəʊ ɡɹeɪt pɹəfʌndɪti, mɪstə taʊnsɛnd siːmd tuː ɒfə fɔː wɒt ðeɪ wɜː wɜːθ, and az eɪ kɒntɹɪbjuːʃən tuː an ɐkweɪntəns.

100856|04-000031|she simply let him put his arm round her waist -- as she did so it occurred to her more vividly than it had ever done before, that this was a singular place for a gentleman's arm to be -- and in a moment he was guiding her round the room in the harmonious rotation of the polka.|ʃiː sɪmpli lɛt hɪm pʊt hɪz ɑːm ɹaʊnd hɜː weɪst -- az ʃiː dɪd səʊ ɪt əkɜːd tuː hɜː mɔː vɪvɪdli ðɐn ɪt had ɛvə dʌn bɪfɔː, ðat ðɪs wɒz eɪ sɪŋɡjʊlə pleɪs fɔː eɪ dʒɛntəlmənz ɑːm tuː biː -- and ɪn eɪ məʊmənt hiː wɒz ɡaɪdɪŋ hɜː ɹaʊnd ðə ɹuːm ɪn ðə hɑːməʊniəs ɹəʊteɪʃən ɒv ðə pəʊlkə.

100859|04-000034|She fanned herself, and looked at the flowers that were painted on her fan.|ʃiː fand hɜːsɛlf, and lʊkt at ðə flaʊəz ðat wɜː peɪntɪd ɒn hɜː fan.
100860|04-000035|He asked her if she would begin again, and she hesitated to answer, still looking at the flowers.|hiː askt hɜː ɪf ʃiː wʊd bɪɡɪn ɐɡɛn, and ʃiː hɛzɪteɪtɪd tuː ansə, stɪl lʊkɪŋ at ðə flaʊəz.

100862|04-000037|Then Catherine looked up at him;|ðɛn kaθɹɪn lʊkt ʌp at hɪm;
100863|04-000038|he was certainly beautiful, and not at all red.|hiː wɒz sɜːtənli bjuːtifəl, and nɒt at ɔːl ɹɛd.
100864|04-000039|"Yes," she said;| "jɛs," ʃiː sɛd;
100865|04-000040|she hardly knew why, for dancing had never made her dizzy.|ʃiː hɑːdli njuː waɪ, fɔː dansɪŋ had nɛvə meɪd hɜː dɪzi.
100866|04-000041|"Ah, well, in that case," said mister Townsend, "we will sit still and talk."| "ɑː, wɛl, ɪn ðat keɪs," sɛd mɪstə taʊnsɛnd, "wiː wɪl sɪt stɪl and tɔːk."
100867|04-000042|I will find a good place to sit.|aɪ wɪl faɪnd eɪ ɡʊd pleɪs tuː sɪt.
100868|04-000043|He found a good place -- a charming place;|hiː faʊnd eɪ ɡʊd pleɪs -- eɪ tʃɑːmɪŋ pleɪs;
100869|04-000044|a little sofa that seemed meant only for two persons.|eɪ lɪtəl səʊfə ðat siːmd mɛnt əʊnli fɔː tuː pɜːsənz.
100870|04-000045|The rooms by this time were very full;|ðə ɹuːmz baɪ ðɪs taɪm wɜː vɛɹi fʊl;
100871|04-000046|the dancers increased in number, and people stood close in front of them, turning their backs, so that Catherine and her companion seemed secluded and unobserved.|ðə dansəz ɪŋkɹiːst ɪn nʌmbə, and piːpəl stʊd kləʊs ɪn fɹʌnt ɒv ðɛm, tɜːnɪŋ ðeə baks, səʊ ðat kaθɹɪn and hɜː kəmpaniən siːmd sɪkluːdɪd and ʌnɒbzɜːvd.

100873|04-000048|but he still did all the talking.|bʌt hiː stɪl dɪd ɔːl ðə tɔːkɪŋ.
100874|04-000049|Catherine leaned back in her place, with her eyes fixed upon him, smiling and thinking him very clever.|kaθɹɪn liːnd bak ɪn hɜː pleɪs, wɪð hɜː aɪz fɪkst əpɒn hɪm, smaɪlɪŋ and θɪŋkɪŋ hɪm vɛɹi klɛvə.
100875|04-000050|He had features like young men in pictures;|hiː had fiːtʃəz laɪk jʌŋ mɛn ɪn pɪktʃəz;
100876|04-000051|Catherine had never seen such features -- so delicate, so chiselled and finished -- among the young New Yorkers whom she passed in the streets and met at parties.|kaθɹɪn had nɛvə siːn sʌtʃ fiːtʃəz -- səʊ dɛlɪkət, səʊ tʃɪzəld and fɪnɪʃt -- ɐmʌŋ ðə jʌŋ njuː jɔːkəz huːm ʃiː past ɪn ðə stɹiːts and mɛt at pɑːtiz.

100878|04-000053|Catherine thought he looked like a statue.|kaθɹɪn θɔːt hiː lʊkt laɪk eɪ statʃuː.
100879|04-000054|But a statue would not talk like that, and, above all, would not have eyes of so rare a colour.|bʌt eɪ statʃuː wʊd nɒt tɔːk laɪk ðat, and, əbʌv ɔːl, wʊd nɒt hav aɪz ɒv səʊ ɹeə eɪ kʌlə.
100880|04-000055|He had never been at misess Almond's before;|hiː had nɛvə biːn at mɪsɛs ɒlməndz bɪfɔː;
100881|04-000056|he felt very much like a stranger;|hiː fɛlt vɛɹi mʌtʃ laɪk eɪ stɹeɪndʒə;
100882|04-000057|and it was very kind of Catherine to take pity on him.|and ɪt wɒz vɛɹi kaɪnd ɒv kaθɹɪn tuː teɪk pɪti ɒn hɪm.
100883|04-000058|He was Arthur Townsend's cousin -- not very near;|hiː wɒz ɑːθə taʊnsɛndz kʌzən -- nɒt vɛɹi niə;
100884|04-000059|several times removed -- and Arthur had brought him to present him to the family.|sɛvɹəl taɪmz ɹɪmuːvd -- and ɑːθə had bɹɔːt hɪm tuː pɹɛzənt hɪm tuː ðə famɪli.
100885|04-000060|In fact, he was a great stranger in New York.|ɪn fakt, hiː wɒz eɪ ɡɹeɪt stɹeɪndʒə ɪn njuː jɔːk.
100886|04-000061|It was his native place;|ɪt wɒz hɪz neɪtɪv pleɪs;
100887|04-000062|but he had not been there for many years.|bʌt hiː had nɒt biːn ðeə fɔː mɛni jiəz.
100888|04-000063|He had been knocking about the world, and living in far-away lands;|hiː had biːn nɒkɪŋ ɐbaʊt ðə wɜːld, and lɪvɪŋ ɪn fɑːɹəweɪ landz;
100889|04-000064|he had only come back a month or two before.|hiː had əʊnli kʌm bak eɪ mʌnθ ɔː tuː bɪfɔː.
100890|04-000065|New York was very pleasant, only he felt lonely.|njuː jɔːk wɒz vɛɹi plɛzənt, əʊnli hiː fɛlt ləʊnli.
100891|04-000066|"You see, people forget you," he said, smiling at Catherine with his delightful gaze, while he leaned forward obliquely, turning towards her, with his elbows on his knees.| "juː siː, piːpəl fəɡɛt juː," hiː sɛd, smaɪlɪŋ at kaθɹɪn wɪð hɪz dɪlaɪtfəl ɡeɪz, waɪl hiː liːnd fɔːwəd əbliːkli, tɜːnɪŋ təwɔːdz hɜː, wɪð hɪz ɛlbəʊz ɒn hɪz niːz.
100892|04-000067|It seemed to Catherine that no one who had once seen him would ever forget him;|ɪt siːmd tuː kaθɹɪn ðat nəʊ wɒn huː had wʌns siːn hɪm wʊd ɛvə fəɡɛt hɪm;
100893|04-000068|but though she made this reflexion she kept it to herself, almost as you would keep something precious.|bʌt ðəʊ ʃiː meɪd ðɪs ɹiːflɛksiən ʃiː kɛpt ɪt tuː hɜːsɛlf, ɔːlməʊst az juː wʊd kiːp sʌmθɪŋ pɹɛʃəs.
100894|04-000069|They sat there for some time.|ðeɪ sat ðeə fɔː sʌm taɪm.
100895|04-000070|He was very amusing.|hiː wɒz vɛɹi ɐmjuːzɪŋ.
100896|04-000071|He asked her about the people that were near them;|hiː askt hɜː ɐbaʊt ðə piːpəl ðat wɜː niə ðɛm;
100897|04-000072|he tried to guess who some of them were, and he made the most laughable mistakes.|hiː tɹaɪd tuː ɡɛs huː sʌm ɒv ðɛm wɜː, and hiː meɪd ðə məʊst lafəbəl mɪsteɪks.
100898|04-000073|He criticised them very freely, in a positive, off-hand way.|hiː kɹɪtɪsaɪzd ðɛm vɛɹi fɹiːli, ɪn eɪ pɒzɪtɪv, ɒfhand weɪ.
100899|04-000074|Catherine had never heard any one -- especially any young man -- talk just like that.|kaθɹɪn had nɛvə hɜːd ɛni wɒn -- ɪspɛʃəli ɛni jʌŋ man -- tɔːk dʒʌst laɪk ðat.
100900|04-000075|It was the way a young man might talk in a novel;|ɪt wɒz ðə weɪ eɪ jʌŋ man maɪt tɔːk ɪn eɪ nɒvəl;
100901|04-000076|or better still, in a play, on the stage, close before the footlights, looking at the audience, and with every one looking at him, so that you wondered at his presence of mind.|ɔː bɛtə stɪl, ɪn eɪ pleɪ, ɒn ðə steɪdʒ, kləʊs bɪfɔː ðə fʊtlaɪts, lʊkɪŋ at ðə ɔːdiəns, and wɪð ɛvɹɪ wɒn lʊkɪŋ at hɪm, səʊ ðat juː wʌndəd at hɪz pɹɛzəns ɒv maɪnd.
100902|04-000077|And yet mister Townsend was not like an actor;|and jɛt mɪstə taʊnsɛnd wɒz nɒt laɪk an aktə;
100903|04-000078|he seemed so sincere, so natural.|hiː siːmd səʊ sɪnsiə, səʊ natʃəɹəl.
100904|04-000079|This was very interesting;|ðɪs wɒz vɛɹi ɪntɹɪstɪŋ;
100905|04-000080|but in the midst of it Marian Almond came pushing through the crowd, with a little ironical cry, when she found these young people still together, which made every one turn round, and cost Catherine a conscious blush.|bʌt ɪn ðə mɪdst ɒv ɪt maɹiən ɒlmənd keɪm pʊʃɪŋ θɹuː ðə kɹaʊd, wɪð eɪ lɪtəl aɪɹɒnɪkəl kɹaɪ, wɛn ʃiː faʊnd ðiːz jʌŋ piːpəl stɪl təɡɛðə, wɪtʃ meɪd ɛvɹɪ wɒn tɜːn ɹaʊnd, and kɒst kaθɹɪn eɪ kɒnʃəs blʌʃ.
100907|04-000082|"We shall meet again!" he said to Catherine as he left her, and Catherine thought it a very original speech.| "wiː ʃal miːt ɐɡɛn!" hiː sɛd tuː kaθɹɪn az hiː lɛft hɜː, and kaθɹɪn θɔːt ɪt eɪ vɛɹi əɹɪdʒɪnəl spiːtʃ.
100908|04-000083|Her cousin took her by the arm, and made her walk about.|hɜː kʌzən tʊk hɜː baɪ ðə ɑːm, and meɪd hɜː wɔːk ɐbaʊt.
100909|04-000084|"I needn't ask you what you think of Morris!" the young girl exclaimed.| "aɪ niːdnt ask juː wɒt juː θɪŋk ɒv mɒɹɪs!" ðə jʌŋ ɡɜːl ɛkskleɪmd.
100910|04-000085|Is that his name?|ɪz ðat hɪz neɪm?
100911|04-000086|"I don't ask you what you think of his name, but what you think of himself," said Marian.| "aɪ dəʊnt ask juː wɒt juː θɪŋk ɒv hɪz neɪm, bʌt wɒt juː θɪŋk ɒv hɪmsɛlf," sɛd maɹiən.
100912|04-000087|Oh, nothing particular!|əʊ, nʌθɪŋ pətɪkjʊlə!
100913|04-000088|Catherine answered, dissembling for the first time in her life.|kaθɹɪn ansəd, dɪsɛmblɪŋ fɔː ðə fɜːst taɪm ɪn hɜː laɪf.
100914|04-000089|"I have half a mind to tell him that!" cried Marian.| "aɪ hav hɑːf eɪ maɪnd tuː tɛl hɪm ðat!" kɹaɪd maɹiən.
100915|04-000090|It will do him good.|ɪt wɪl duː hɪm ɡʊd.
100916|04-000091|He's so terribly conceited.|hiːz səʊ tɛɹɪbli kənsiːtɪd.
100917|04-000092|"Conceited?" said Catherine, staring.| "kənsiːtɪd?" sɛd kaθɹɪn, steəɹɪŋ.
100918|04-000093|So Arthur says, and Arthur knows about him.|səʊ ɑːθə sɛz, and ɑːθə nəʊz ɐbaʊt hɪm.
100919|04-000094|Oh, don't tell him!|əʊ, dəʊnt tɛl hɪm!
100920|04-000095|Catherine murmured imploringly.|kaθɹɪn mɜːməd ɪmplɔːɹɪŋli.
100921|04-000096|Don't tell him he's conceited?|dəʊnt tɛl hɪm hiːz kənsiːtɪd?
100922|04-000097|I have told him so a dozen times.|aɪ hav təʊld hɪm səʊ eɪ dʌzən taɪmz.
100923|04-000098|At this profession of audacity Catherine looked down at her little companion in amazement.|at ðɪs pɹəfɛʃən ɒv ɔːdasɪti kaθɹɪn lʊkt daʊn at hɜː lɪtəl kəmpaniən ɪn ɐmeɪzmənt.
100924|04-000099|She supposed it was because Marian was going to be married that she took so much on herself;|ʃiː səpəʊzd ɪt wɒz bɪkɒz maɹiən wɒz ɡəʊɪŋ tuː biː maɹid ðat ʃiː tʊk səʊ mʌtʃ ɒn hɜːsɛlf;
100925|04-000100|but she wondered too, whether, when she herself should become engaged, such exploits would be expected of her.|bʌt ʃiː wʌndəd tuː, wɛðə, wɛn ʃiː hɜːsɛlf ʃʊd bɪkʌm ɛŋɡeɪdʒd, sʌtʃ ɛksplɔɪts wʊd biː ɛkspɛktɪd ɒv hɜː.
100927|04-000102|In front of her was a gentleman, bending forward a little, with his back turned to Catherine.|ɪn fɹʌnt ɒv hɜː wɒz eɪ dʒɛntəlmən, bɛndɪŋ fɔːwəd eɪ lɪtəl, wɪð hɪz bak tɜːnd tuː kaθɹɪn.

100929|04-000104|for when he had left her, at Marian's instigation, he had retreated in the best order, without turning round.|fɔː wɛn hiː had lɛft hɜː, at mɐɹiːənz ɪnstɪɡeɪʃən, hiː had ɹɪtɹiːtɪd ɪn ðə bɛst ɔːdə, wɪðaʊt tɜːnɪŋ ɹaʊnd.
100930|04-000105|Morris Townsend -- the name had already become very familiar to her, as if some one had been repeating it in her ear for the last half-hour -- Morris Townsend was giving his impressions of the company to her aunt, as he had done to herself;|mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd -- ðə neɪm had ɔːlɹɛdi bɪkʌm vɛɹi fəmɪliə tuː hɜː, az ɪf sʌm wɒn had biːn ɹɪpiːtɪŋ ɪt ɪn hɜː iə fɔː ðə last hɑːfaʊə -- mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd wɒz ɡɪvɪŋ hɪz ɪmpɹɛʃənz ɒv ðə kʌmpəni tuː hɜː ant, az hiː had dʌn tuː hɜːsɛlf;
100931|04-000106|he was saying clever things, and misess Penniman was smiling, as if she approved of them.|hiː wɒz seɪɪŋ klɛvə θɪŋz, and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz smaɪlɪŋ, az ɪf ʃiː ɐpɹuːvd ɒv ðɛm.
100932|04-000107|As soon as Catherine had perceived this she moved away;|az suːn az kaθɹɪn had pəsiːvd ðɪs ʃiː muːvd ɐweɪ;
100933|04-000108|she would not have liked him to turn round and see her.|ʃiː wʊd nɒt hav laɪkt hɪm tuː tɜːn ɹaʊnd and siː hɜː.
100934|04-000109|But it gave her pleasure -- the whole thing.|bʌt ɪt ɡeɪv hɜː plɛʒə -- ðə həʊl θɪŋ.
100935|04-000110|That he should talk with misess Penniman, with whom she lived and whom she saw and talked with every day -- that seemed to keep him near her, and to make him even easier to contemplate than if she herself had been the object of his civilities;|ðat hiː ʃʊd tɔːk wɪð mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, wɪð huːm ʃiː lɪvd and huːm ʃiː sɔː and tɔːkt wɪð ɛvɹɪ deɪ -- ðat siːmd tuː kiːp hɪm niə hɜː, and tuː meɪk hɪm iːvən iːziə tuː kɒntəmpleɪt ðɐn ɪf ʃiː hɜːsɛlf had biːn ðə ɒbdʒɛkt ɒv hɪz sɪvɪlɪtiz;
100936|04-000111|and that Aunt Lavinia should like him, should not be shocked or startled by what he said, this also appeared to the girl a personal gain;|and ðat ant lavɪniə ʃʊd laɪk hɪm, ʃʊd nɒt biː ʃɒkt ɔː stɑːtəld baɪ wɒt hiː sɛd, ðɪs ɔːlsəʊ ɐpiəd tuː ðə ɡɜːl eɪ pɜːsənəl ɡeɪn;
100937|04-000112|for Aunt Lavinia's standard was extremely high, planted as it was over the grave of her late husband, in which, as she had convinced every one, the very genius of conversation was buried.|fɔː ant lavɪniəz standəd wɒz ɛkstɹiːmli haɪ, plantɪd az ɪt wɒz əʊvə ðə ɡɹeɪv ɒv hɜː leɪt hʌsbənd, ɪn wɪtʃ, az ʃiː had kənvɪnst ɛvɹɪ wɒn, ðə vɛɹi dʒiːnɪəs ɒv kɒnvəseɪʃən wɒz bɛɹid.
100938|04-000113|One of the Almond boys, as Catherine called him, invited our heroine to dance a quadrille, and for a quarter of an hour her feet at least were occupied.|wɒn ɒv ðə ɒlmənd bɔɪz, az kaθɹɪn kɔːld hɪm, ɪnvaɪtɪd aʊə hɛɹəʊɪn tuː dans eɪ kwɒdɹɪl, and fɔː eɪ kwɔːtə ɒv an aʊə hɜː fiːt at liːst wɜː ɒkjʊpaɪd.

100942|04-000117|doctor Sloper had usually a little smile, never a very big one, and with his little smile playing in his clear eyes and on his neatly-shaved lips, he looked at his daughter's crimson gown.|dɒktə sləʊpə had juːʒuːəli eɪ lɪtəl smaɪl, nɛvə eɪ vɛɹi bɪɡ wɒn, and wɪð hɪz lɪtəl smaɪl pleɪɪŋ ɪn hɪz kliə aɪz and ɒn hɪz niːtlɪʃeɪvd lɪps, hiː lʊkt at hɪz dɔːtəz kɹɪmsən ɡaʊn.

100944|04-000119|You would have surprised him if you had told him so;|juː wʊd hav səpɹaɪzd hɪm ɪf juː had təʊld hɪm səʊ;

100947|04-000122|but she had to cut her pleasure out of the piece, as it were.|bʌt ʃiː had tuː kʌt hɜː plɛʒə aʊt ɒv ðə piːs, az ɪt wɜː.
100948|04-000123|There were portions left over, light remnants and snippets of irony, which she never knew what to do with, which seemed too delicate for her own use;|ðeə wɜː pɔːʃənz lɛft əʊvə, laɪt ɹɛmnənts and snɪpɪts ɒv aɪɹəni, wɪtʃ ʃiː nɛvə njuː wɒt tuː duː wɪð, wɪtʃ siːmd tuː dɛlɪkət fɔː hɜː əʊn juːs;
100949|04-000124|and yet Catherine, lamenting the limitations of her understanding, felt that they were too valuable to waste and had a belief that if they passed over her head they yet contributed to the general sum of human wisdom.|and jɛt kaθɹɪn, lɐmɛntɪŋ ðə lɪmɪteɪʃənz ɒv hɜː ʌndəstandɪŋ, fɛlt ðat ðeɪ wɜː tuː valjuːəbəl tuː weɪst and had eɪ bɪliːf ðat ɪf ðeɪ past əʊvə hɜː hɛd ðeɪ jɛt kəntɹɪbjuːtɪd tuː ðə dʒɛnəɹəl sʌm ɒv hjuːmən wɪzdəm.

100957|04-000132|Catherine hesitated a moment;|kaθɹɪn hɛzɪteɪtɪd eɪ məʊmənt;
100958|04-000133|and then, looking away, "I am rather tired," she murmured.|and ðɛn, lʊkɪŋ ɐweɪ, "aɪ am ɹɑːðə taɪəd," ʃiː mɜːməd.
100960|04-000135|For the second time in her life she made an indirect answer;|fɔː ðə sɛkənd taɪm ɪn hɜː laɪf ʃiː meɪd an ɪndaɪɹɛkt ansə;
100961|04-000136|and the beginning of a period of dissimulation is certainly a significant date.|and ðə bɪɡɪnɪŋ ɒv eɪ piəɹɪəd ɒv dɪsɪmjʊleɪʃən ɪz sɜːtənli eɪ sɪɡnɪfɪkənt deɪt.
100962|04-000137|Catherine was not so easily tired as that.|kaθɹɪn wɒz nɒt səʊ iːzili taɪəd az ðat.
100963|04-000138|Nevertheless, in the carriage, as they drove home, she was as quiet as if fatigue had been her portion.|nɛvəðəlɛs, ɪn ðə kaɹɪdʒ, az ðeɪ dɹəʊv həʊm, ʃiː wɒz az kwaɪət az ɪf fɐtiːɡ had biːn hɜː pɔːʃən.
100964|04-000139|doctor Sloper's manner of addressing his sister Lavinia had a good deal of resemblance to the tone he had adopted towards Catherine.|dɒktə sləʊpəz manə ɒv ɐdɹɛsɪŋ hɪz sɪstə lavɪniə had eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv ɹɪzɛmbləns tuː ðə təʊn hiː had ɐdɒptɪd təwɔːdz kaθɹɪn.

100966|04-000141|"Oh, my good brother!" murmured misess Penniman, in deprecation.| "əʊ, maɪ ɡʊd bɹʌðə!" mɜːməd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, ɪn dɛpɹɪkeɪʃən.
100967|04-000142|He seemed uncommonly tender.|hiː siːmd ʌŋkɒmənli tɛndə.

100970|04-000145|It was to Catherine;|ɪt wɒz tuː kaθɹɪn;
100971|04-000146|he talked to me of her.|hiː tɔːkt tuː miː ɒv hɜː.

100973|04-000148|"Oh, Aunt Penniman!" she exclaimed faintly.| "əʊ, ant pɛnɪmən!" ʃiː ɛkskleɪmd feɪntli.
100975|04-000150|he is very clever;|hiː ɪz vɛɹi klɛvə;

100981|04-000156|Catherine did not say to herself in the dark, "My dress only?" misess Penniman's announcement struck her by its richness, not by its meagreness.|kaθɹɪn dɪd nɒt seɪ tuː hɜːsɛlf ɪn ðə dɑːk, "maɪ dɹɛs əʊnli?" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz ɐnaʊnsmənt stɹʌk hɜː baɪ ɪts ɹɪtʃnəs, nɒt baɪ ɪts miːɡənəs.

100983|04-000158|"I don't believe he thinks of that," said misess Penniman;| "aɪ dəʊnt bɪliːv hiː θɪŋks ɒv ðat," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən;
100984|04-000159|he is too refined.|hiː ɪz tuː ɹɪfaɪnd.

100993|04-000168|"He asked to be introduced to me," said misess Penniman, with a certain grandeur;| "hiː askt tuː biː ɪntɹədjuːst tuː miː," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, wɪð eɪ sɜːtən ɡɹandjʊə;

100995|04-000170|Jefferson was mister Almond.|dʒɛfəsən wɒz mɪstə ɒlmənd.

100999|05-000001|he learned what he had asked some three or four days later, after Morris Townsend, with his cousin, had called in Washington Square.|hiː lɜːnd wɒt hiː had askt sʌm θɹiː ɔː fɔː deɪz leɪtə, aftə mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd, wɪð hɪz kʌzən, had kɔːld ɪn wɒʃɪŋtən skweə.
101000|05-000002|misess Penniman did not tell her brother, on the drive home, that she had intimated to this agreeable young man, whose name she did not know, that, with her niece, she should be very glad to see him;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən dɪd nɒt tɛl hɜː bɹʌðə, ɒn ðə dɹaɪv həʊm, ðat ʃiː had ɪntɪmeɪtɪd tuː ðɪs ɐɡɹiːəbəl jʌŋ man, huːz neɪm ʃiː dɪd nɒt nəʊ, ðat, wɪð hɜː niːs, ʃiː ʃʊd biː vɛɹi ɡlad tuː siː hɪm;

101004|05-000006|These events came to pass late in the autumn, and Catherine and her aunt had been sitting together in the closing dusk, by the firelight, in the high back parlour.|ðiːz ɪvɛnts keɪm tuː pas leɪt ɪn ðə ɔːtʌm, and kaθɹɪn and hɜː ant had biːn sɪtɪŋ təɡɛðə ɪn ðə kləʊzɪŋ dʌsk, baɪ ðə faɪəlaɪt, ɪn ðə haɪ bak pɑːlə.
101005|05-000007|Arthur Townsend fell to Catherine's portion, while his companion placed himself on the sofa, beside misess Penniman.|ɑːθə taʊnsɛnd fɛl tuː kaθɹɪnz pɔːʃən, waɪl hɪz kəmpaniən pleɪst hɪmsɛlf ɒn ðə səʊfə, bɪsaɪd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
101006|05-000008|Catherine had hitherto not been a harsh critic;|kaθɹɪn had hɪðətuː nɒt biːn eɪ hɑːʃ kɹɪtɪk;
101007|05-000009|she was easy to please -- she liked to talk with young men.|ʃiː wɒz iːzi tuː pliːz -- ʃiː laɪkt tuː tɔːk wɪð jʌŋ mɛn.
101008|05-000010|But Marian's betrothed, this evening, made her feel vaguely fastidious;|bʌt mɐɹiːənz bɪtɹəʊðd, ðɪs iːvnɪŋ, meɪd hɜː fiːl veɪɡli fastɪdiəs;
101009|05-000011|he sat looking at the fire and rubbing his knees with his hands.|hiː sat lʊkɪŋ at ðə faɪə and ɹʌbɪŋ hɪz niːz wɪð hɪz handz.
101010|05-000012|As for Catherine, she scarcely even pretended to keep up the conversation;|az fɔː kaθɹɪn, ʃiː skeəsli iːvən pɹɪtɛndɪd tuː kiːp ʌp ðə kɒnvəseɪʃən;
101011|05-000013|her attention had fixed itself on the other side of the room;|hɜː ɐtɛnʃən had fɪkst ɪtsɛlf ɒn ðə ʌðə saɪd ɒv ðə ɹuːm;
101012|05-000014|she was listening to what went on between the other mister Townsend and her aunt.|ʃiː wɒz lɪsənɪŋ tuː wɒt wɛnt ɒn bɪtwiːn ðə ʌðə mɪstə taʊnsɛnd and hɜː ant.
101013|05-000015|Every now and then he looked over at Catherine herself and smiled, as if to show that what he said was for her benefit too.|ɛvɹɪ naʊ and ðɛn hiː lʊkt əʊvə at kaθɹɪn hɜːsɛlf and smaɪld, az ɪf tuː ʃəʊ ðat wɒt hiː sɛd wɒz fɔː hɜː bɛnɪfɪt tuː.
101015|05-000017|But she was afraid of seeming bold -- of looking eager;|bʌt ʃiː wɒz ɐfɹeɪd ɒv siːmɪŋ bəʊld -- ɒv lʊkɪŋ iːɡə;
101016|05-000018|and, besides, it would not have been polite to Marian's little suitor.|and, bɪsaɪdz, ɪt wʊd nɒt hav biːn pəlaɪt tuː mɐɹiːənz lɪtəl suːtə.
101017|05-000019|She wondered why the other gentleman had picked out her aunt -- how he came to have so much to say to misess Penniman, to whom, usually, young men were not especially devoted.|ʃiː wʌndəd waɪ ðə ʌðə dʒɛntəlmən had pɪkt aʊt hɜː ant -- haʊ hiː keɪm tuː hav səʊ mʌtʃ tuː seɪ tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, tuː huːm, juːʒuːəli, jʌŋ mɛn wɜː nɒt ɪspɛʃəli dɪvəʊtɪd.
101018|05-000020|She was not at all jealous of Aunt Lavinia, but she was a little envious, and above all she wondered;|ʃiː wɒz nɒt at ɔːl dʒɛləs ɒv ant lavɪniə, bʌt ʃiː wɒz eɪ lɪtəl ɛnviəs, and əbʌv ɔːl ʃiː wʌndəd;
101019|05-000021|for Morris Townsend was an object on which she found that her imagination could exercise itself indefinitely.|fɔː mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd wɒz an ɒbdʒɛkt ɒn wɪtʃ ʃiː faʊnd ðat hɜː ɪmadʒɪneɪʃən kʊd ɛksəsaɪz ɪtsɛlf ɪndɛfɪnətli.
101020|05-000022|His cousin had been describing a house that he had taken in view of his union with Marian, and the domestic conveniences he meant to introduce into it;|hɪz kʌzən had biːn dɪskɹaɪbɪŋ eɪ haʊs ðat hiː had teɪkən ɪn vjuː ɒv hɪz juːniən wɪð maɹiən, and ðə dəmɛstɪk kənviːnɪənsɪz hiː mɛnt tuː ɪntɹədjuːs ɪntʊ ɪt;

101029|05-000031|If I wasn't afraid Marian would be lonely, I'd go up there -- right up to the top -- and wait for it.|ɪf aɪ wɒsnt ɐfɹeɪd maɹiən wʊd biː ləʊnli, aɪdiː ɡəʊ ʌp ðeə -- ɹaɪt ʌp tuː ðə tɒp -- and weɪt fɔː ɪt.

101032|05-000034|She says that if she's got to be the first settler she had better go out to Minnesota.|ʃiː sɛz ðat ɪf ʃɪz ɡɒt tuː biː ðə fɜːst sɛtlə ʃiː had bɛtə ɡəʊ aʊt tuː mɪnɪsəʊtə.

101042|05-000044|Catherine bestowed on her junior visitor only just enough attention to feel that this was not the way mister Morris Townsend had talked the other night, or that he was talking now to her fortunate aunt.|kaθɹɪn bɪstəʊd ɒn hɜː dʒuːnjə vɪzɪtə əʊnli dʒʌst ɪnʌf ɐtɛnʃən tuː fiːl ðat ðɪs wɒz nɒt ðə weɪ mɪstə mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd had tɔːkt ðə ʌðə naɪt, ɔː ðat hiː wɒz tɔːkɪŋ naʊ tuː hɜː fɔːtʃənət ant.

101066|05-000068|"He's more like a foreigner," Catherine suggested.| "hiːz mɔː laɪk eɪ fɒɹənə," kaθɹɪn sədʒɛstɪd.
101067|05-000069|"Well, I never knew a foreigner!" said young Townsend, in a tone which seemed to indicate that his ignorance had been optional.| "wɛl, aɪ nɛvə njuː eɪ fɒɹənə!" sɛd jʌŋ taʊnsɛnd, ɪn eɪ təʊn wɪtʃ siːmd tuː ɪndɪkeɪt ðat hɪz ɪɡnəɹəns had biːn ɒpʃənəl.

101069|05-000071|"They say they are generally brilliant," she added vaguely.| "ðeɪ seɪ ðeɪ ɑː dʒɛnəɹəli bɹɪliənt," ʃiː adɪd veɪɡli.
101070|05-000072|Well, the people of this city are clever enough for me.|wɛl, ðə piːpəl ɒv ðɪs sɪti ɑː klɛvə ɪnʌf fɔː miː.

101072|05-000074|but they ain't!|bʌt ðeɪ eɪnt!
101073|05-000075|"I suppose you can't be too clever," said Catherine, still with humility.| "aɪ səpəʊz juː kant biː tuː klɛvə," sɛd kaθɹɪn, stɪl wɪð hjuːmɪlɪti.
101074|05-000076|I don't know.|aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ.
101075|05-000077|I know some people that call my cousin too clever.|aɪ nəʊ sʌm piːpəl ðat kɔːl maɪ kʌzən tuː klɛvə.
101076|05-000078|Catherine listened to this statement with extreme interest, and a feeling that if Morris Townsend had a fault it would naturally be that one.|kaθɹɪn lɪsənd tuː ðɪs steɪtmənt wɪð ɛkstɹiːm ɪntɹɪst, and eɪ fiːlɪŋ ðat ɪf mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd had eɪ fɒlt ɪt wʊd natʃəɹəli biː ðat wɒn.
101077|05-000079|But she did not commit herself, and in a moment she asked: "Now that he has come back, will he stay here always?"|bʌt ʃiː dɪd nɒt kəmɪt hɜːsɛlf, and ɪn eɪ məʊmənt ʃiː askt: "naʊ ðat hiː haz kʌm bak, wɪl hiː steɪ hiə ɔːlweɪz?"
101078|05-000080|"Ah," said Arthur, "if he can get something to do."| "ɑː," sɛd ɑːθə, "ɪf hiː kan ɡɛt sʌmθɪŋ tuː duː."
101079|05-000081|Something to do?|sʌmθɪŋ tuː duː?

101082|05-000084|"Hasn't he got any?" said Catherine, who had never heard of a young man -- of the upper class -- in this situation.| "hasnt hiː ɡɒt ɛni?" sɛd kaθɹɪn, huː had nɛvə hɜːd ɒv eɪ jʌŋ man -- ɒv ðə ʌpə klas -- ɪn ðɪs sɪtʃuːeɪʃən.

101084|05-000086|he's looking round.|hiːz lʊkɪŋ ɹaʊnd.
101085|05-000087|But he can't find anything.|bʌt hiː kant faɪnd ɛnɪθɪŋ.
101086|05-000088|"I am very sorry," Catherine permitted herself to observe.| "aɪ am vɛɹi sɒɹi," kaθɹɪn pəmɪtɪd hɜːsɛlf tuː ɒbzɜːv.
101087|05-000089|"Oh, he doesn't mind," said young Townsend.| "əʊ, hiː dʌzənt maɪnd," sɛd jʌŋ taʊnsɛnd.
101088|05-000090|He takes it easy -- he isn't in a hurry.|hiː teɪks ɪt iːzi -- hiː ɪsnt ɪn eɪ hʌɹi.
101089|05-000091|He is very particular.|hiː ɪz vɛɹi pətɪkjʊlə.
101090|05-000092|Catherine thought he naturally would be, and gave herself up for some moments to the contemplation of this idea, in several of its bearings.|kaθɹɪn θɔːt hiː natʃəɹəli wʊd biː, and ɡeɪv hɜːsɛlf ʌp fɔː sʌm məʊmənts tuː ðə kɒntəmpleɪʃən ɒv ðɪs aɪdiə, ɪn sɛvɹəl ɒv ɪts beəɹɪŋz.
101091|05-000093|"Won't his father take him into his business -- his office?" she at last inquired.| "wɒnt hɪz fɑːðə teɪk hɪm ɪntʊ hɪz bɪznəs -- hɪz ɒfɪs?" ʃiː at last ɪŋkwaɪəd.

101093|05-000095|Your sister can't help you much.|jɔː sɪstə kant hɛlp juː mʌtʃ.
101094|05-000096|It seemed to Catherine that if she were his sister she would disprove this axiom.|ɪt siːmd tuː kaθɹɪn ðat ɪf ʃiː wɜː hɪz sɪstə ʃiː wʊd dɪspɹuːv ðɪs aksɪəm.
101095|05-000097|"Is she -- is she pleasant?" she asked in a moment.| "ɪz ʃiː -- ɪz ʃiː plɛzənt?" ʃiː askt ɪn eɪ məʊmənt.
101096|05-000098|"I don't know -- I believe she's very respectable," said young Townsend.| "aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ -- aɪ bɪliːv ʃɪz vɛɹi ɹɪspɛktəbəl," sɛd jʌŋ taʊnsɛnd.
101097|05-000099|And then he looked across to his cousin and began to laugh.|and ðɛn hiː lʊkt əkɹɒs tuː hɪz kʌzən and bɪɡan tuː laf.
101098|05-000100|"Look here, we are talking about you," he added.| "lʊk hiə, wiː ɑː tɔːkɪŋ ɐbaʊt juː," hiː adɪd.
101099|05-000101|Morris Townsend paused in his conversation with misess Penniman, and stared, with a little smile.|mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd pɔːzd ɪn hɪz kɒnvəseɪʃən wɪð mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, and steəd, wɪð eɪ lɪtəl smaɪl.
101100|05-000102|Then he got up, as if he were going.|ðɛn hiː ɡɒt ʌp, az ɪf hiː wɜː ɡəʊɪŋ.
101101|05-000103|"As far as you are concerned, I can't return the compliment," he said to Catherine's companion.| "az fɑː az juː ɑː kənsɜːnd, aɪ kant ɹɪtɜːn ðə kɒmplɪmənt," hiː sɛd tuː kaθɹɪnz kəmpaniən.
101102|05-000104|But as regards Miss Sloper, it's another affair.|bʌt az ɹɪɡɑːdz mɪs sləʊpə, ɪts ɐnʌðə ɐfeə.
101103|05-000105|Catherine thought this little speech wonderfully well turned;|kaθɹɪn θɔːt ðɪs lɪtəl spiːtʃ wʌndəfəli wɛl tɜːnd;
101104|05-000106|but she was embarrassed by it, and she also got up.|bʌt ʃiː wɒz ɛmbaɹəst baɪ ɪt, and ʃiː ɔːlsəʊ ɡɒt ʌp.
101105|05-000107|Morris Townsend stood looking at her and smiling;|mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd stʊd lʊkɪŋ at hɜː and smaɪlɪŋ;
101106|05-000108|he put out his hand for farewell.|hiː pʊt aʊt hɪz hand fɔː feəwɛl.
101107|05-000109|He was going, without having said anything to her;|hiː wɒz ɡəʊɪŋ, wɪðaʊt havɪŋ sɛd ɛnɪθɪŋ tuː hɜː;
101108|05-000110|but even on these terms she was glad to have seen him.|bʌt iːvən ɒn ðiːz tɜːmz ʃiː wɒz ɡlad tuː hav siːn hɪm.
101109|05-000111|"I will tell her what you have said -- when you go!" said misess Penniman, with an insinuating laugh.| "aɪ wɪl tɛl hɜː wɒt juː hav sɛd -- wɛn juː ɡəʊ!" sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, wɪð an ɪnsɪnjuːeɪtɪŋ laf.
101110|05-000112|Catherine blushed, for she felt almost as if they were making sport of her.|kaθɹɪn blʌʃt, fɔː ʃiː fɛlt ɔːlməʊst az ɪf ðeɪ wɜː meɪkɪŋ spɔːt ɒv hɜː.

101112|05-000114|He looked at her still, in spite of her blush;|hiː lʊkt at hɜː stɪl, ɪn spaɪt ɒv hɜː blʌʃ;
101113|05-000115|but very kindly and respectfully.|bʌt vɛɹi kaɪndli and ɹɪspɛktfəli.
101114|05-000116|"I have had no talk with you," he said, "and that was what I came for."| "aɪ hav had nəʊ tɔːk wɪð juː," hiː sɛd, "and ðat wɒz wɒt aɪ keɪm fɔː."
101115|05-000117|But it will be a good reason for coming another time;|bʌt ɪt wɪl biː eɪ ɡʊd ɹiːzən fɔː kʌmɪŋ ɐnʌðə taɪm;

101118|05-000120|With this the two young men took their departure;|wɪð ðɪs ðə tuː jʌŋ mɛn tʊk ðeə dɪpɑːtʃə;
101119|05-000121|after which Catherine, with her blush still lingering, directed a serious and interrogative eye to misess Penniman.|aftə wɪtʃ kaθɹɪn, wɪð hɜː blʌʃ stɪl lɪŋɡəɹɪŋ, daɪɹɛktɪd eɪ siəɹiəs and ɪntɛɹəɡətɪv aɪ tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
101120|05-000122|She was incapable of elaborate artifice, and she resorted to no jocular device -- to no affectation of the belief that she had been maligned -- to learn what she desired.|ʃiː wɒz ɪŋkeɪpəbəl ɒv ɪlabəɹeɪt ɑːtɪfɪs, and ʃiː ɹɪzɔːtɪd tuː nəʊ dʒɒkjʊlə dɪvaɪs -- tuː nəʊ ɐfɪkteɪʃən ɒv ðə bɪliːf ðat ʃiː had biːn məlaɪnd -- tuː lɜːn wɒt ʃiː dɪzaɪəd.

101122|05-000124|misess Penniman came up to her, smiling and nodding a little, looked at her all over, and gave a twist to the knot of ribbon in her neck.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən keɪm ʌp tuː hɜː, smaɪlɪŋ and nɒdɪŋ eɪ lɪtəl, lʊkt at hɜː ɔːl əʊvə, and ɡeɪv eɪ twɪst tuː ðə nɒt ɒv ɹɪbən ɪn hɜː nɛk.

101125|05-000127|Catherine was serious still.|kaθɹɪn wɒz siəɹiəs stɪl.
101126|05-000128|Is that what he told you!|ɪz ðat wɒt hiː təʊld juː!
101127|05-000129|He didn't say so exactly.|hiː dɪdnt seɪ səʊ ɛɡzaktli.

101131|05-000133|Not me, certainly, miss;|nɒt miː, sɜːtənli, mɪs;
101132|05-000134|though I must say he is a hundred times more polite to a person who has no longer extreme youth to recommend her than most of the young men.|ðəʊ aɪ mʌst seɪ hiː ɪz eɪ hʌndɹɪd taɪmz mɔː pəlaɪt tuː eɪ pɜːsən huː haz nəʊ lɒŋɡə ɛkstɹiːm juːθ tuː ɹɛkəmɛnd hɜː ðɐn məʊst ɒv ðə jʌŋ mɛn.

101145|05-000147|Aunt Penniman, however, took no account of it;|ant pɛnɪmən, haʊɛvə, tʊk nəʊ ɐkaʊnt ɒv ɪt;
101146|05-000148|she spoke even with a touch of acrimony.|ʃiː spəʊk iːvən wɪð eɪ tʌtʃ ɒv akɹɪməni.

101166|06-000016|Lavinia simpered, as if this might not be quite enough, and Catherine, with her forehead touching the window-panes, listened to this exchange of epigrams as reservedly as if they had not each been a pin-prick in her own destiny.|lavɪniə sɪmpəd, az ɪf ðɪs maɪt nɒt biː kwaɪt ɪnʌf, and kaθɹɪn, wɪð hɜː fɔːhɛd tʌtʃɪŋ ðə wɪndəʊpeɪnz, lɪsənd tuː ðɪs ɛkstʃeɪndʒ ɒv ɛpɪɡɹamz az ɹɪzɜːvɪdli az ɪf ðeɪ had nɒt iːtʃ biːn eɪ pɪnpɹɪk ɪn hɜː əʊn dɛstɪni.

101180|06-000030|He was certainly much more imperious -- she ended by calling it imperial -- than mister Penniman.|hiː wɒz sɜːtənli mʌtʃ mɔː ɪmpiəɹiəs -- ʃiː ɛndɪd baɪ kɔːlɪŋ ɪt ɪmpiəɹiəl -- ðɐn mɪstə pɛnɪmən.
101181|06-000031|So Catherine saw mister Townsend alone, and her aunt did not come in even at the end of the visit.|səʊ kaθɹɪn sɔː mɪstə taʊnsɛnd ɐləʊn, and hɜː ant dɪd nɒt kʌm ɪn iːvən at ðə ɛnd ɒv ðə vɪzɪt.
101182|06-000032|The visit was a long one;|ðə vɪzɪt wɒz eɪ lɒŋ wɒn;
101184|06-000034|He seemed more at home this time -- more familiar;|hiː siːmd mɔː at həʊm ðɪs taɪm -- mɔː fəmɪliə;
101185|06-000035|lounging a little in the chair, slapping a cushion that was near him with his stick, and looking round the room a good deal, and at the objects it contained, as well as at Catherine;|laʊndʒɪŋ eɪ lɪtəl ɪn ðə tʃeə, slapɪŋ eɪ kʊʃən ðat wɒz niə hɪm wɪð hɪz stɪk, and lʊkɪŋ ɹaʊnd ðə ɹuːm eɪ ɡʊd diːl, and at ðə ɒbdʒɛkts ɪt kənteɪnd, az wɛl az at kaθɹɪn;
101186|06-000036|whom, however, he also contemplated freely.|huːm, haʊɛvə, hiː ɔːlsəʊ kɒntəmpleɪtɪd fɹiːli.
101188|06-000038|it made her think of a young knight in a poem.|ɪt meɪd hɜː θɪŋk ɒv eɪ jʌŋ naɪt ɪn eɪ pəʊɪm.
101189|06-000039|His talk, however, was not particularly knightly;|hɪz tɔːk, haʊɛvə, wɒz nɒt pətɪkjʊləli naɪtli;
101190|06-000040|it was light and easy and friendly;|ɪt wɒz laɪt and iːzi and fɹɛndli;
101191|06-000041|it took a practical turn, and he asked a number of questions about herself -- what were her tastes -- if she liked this and that -- what were her habits.|ɪt tʊk eɪ pɹaktɪkəl tɜːn, and hiː askt eɪ nʌmbə ɒv kwɛstʃənz ɐbaʊt hɜːsɛlf -- wɒt wɜː hɜː teɪsts -- ɪf ʃiː laɪkt ðɪs and ðat -- wɒt wɜː hɜː habɪts.
101192|06-000042|He said to her, with his charming smile, "Tell me about yourself;"|hiː sɛd tuː hɜː, wɪð hɪz tʃɑːmɪŋ smaɪl, "tɛl miː ɐbaʊt jɔːsɛlf;"
101193|06-000043|give me a little sketch.|ɡɪv miː eɪ lɪtəl skɛtʃ.
101194|06-000044|Catherine had very little to tell, and she had no talent for sketching;|kaθɹɪn had vɛɹi lɪtəl tuː tɛl, and ʃiː had nəʊ talənt fɔː skɛtʃɪŋ;
101196|06-000046|She confessed that she was not particularly fond of literature.|ʃiː kənfɛst ðat ʃiː wɒz nɒt pətɪkjʊləli fɒnd ɒv lɪtɹɪtʃə.
101197|06-000047|Morris Townsend agreed with her that books were tiresome things;|mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd ɐɡɹiːd wɪð hɜː ðat bʊks wɜː taɪəsʌm θɪŋz;
101198|06-000048|only, as he said, you had to read a good many before you found it out.|əʊnli, az hiː sɛd, juː had tuː ɹiːd eɪ ɡʊd mɛni bɪfɔː juː faʊnd ɪt aʊt.
101200|06-000050|To see for yourself -- that was the great thing;|tuː siː fɔː jɔːsɛlf -- ðat wɒz ðə ɡɹeɪt θɪŋ;
101201|06-000051|he always tried to see for himself.|hiː ɔːlweɪz tɹaɪd tuː siː fɔː hɪmsɛlf.
101202|06-000052|He had seen all the principal actors -- he had been to all the best theatres in London and Paris.|hiː had siːn ɔːl ðə pɹɪnsɪpəl aktəz -- hiː had biːn tuː ɔːl ðə bɛst θiətəz ɪn lʌndən and paɹɪs.
101203|06-000053|But the actors were always like the authors -- they always exaggerated.|bʌt ðə aktəz wɜː ɔːlweɪz laɪk ðə ɔːθəz -- ðeɪ ɔːlweɪz ɛɡzadʒəɹeɪtɪd.
101204|06-000054|He liked everything to be natural.|hiː laɪkt ɛvɹɪθɪŋ tuː biː natʃəɹəl.
101205|06-000055|Suddenly he stopped, looking at Catherine with his smile.|sʌdənli hiː stɒpt, lʊkɪŋ at kaθɹɪn wɪð hɪz smaɪl.
101206|06-000056|That's what I like you for;|ðats wɒt aɪ laɪk juː fɔː;
101207|06-000057|you are so natural!|juː ɑː səʊ natʃəɹəl!
101208|06-000058|"Excuse me," he added;| "ɛkskjuːs miː," hiː adɪd;
101209|06-000059|you see I am natural myself!|juː siː aɪ am natʃəɹəl maɪsɛlf!
101210|06-000060|And before she had time to think whether she excused him or not -- which afterwards, at leisure, she became conscious that she did -- he began to talk about music, and to say that it was his greatest pleasure in life.|and bɪfɔː ʃiː had taɪm tuː θɪŋk wɛðə ʃiː ɛkskjuːst hɪm ɔː nɒt -- wɪtʃ aftəwədz, at lɛʒə, ʃiː bɪkeɪm kɒnʃəs ðat ʃiː dɪd -- hiː bɪɡan tuː tɔːk ɐbaʊt mjuːzɪk, and tuː seɪ ðat ɪt wɒz hɪz ɡɹeɪtɪst plɛʒə ɪn laɪf.
101211|06-000061|He had heard all the great singers in Paris and London -- Pasta and Rubini and Lablache -- and when you had done that, you could say that you knew what singing was.|hiː had hɜːd ɔːl ðə ɡɹeɪt sɪŋəz ɪn paɹɪs and lʌndən -- pastə and ɹuːbiːnɪ and lablaʃ -- and wɛn juː had dʌn ðat, juː kʊd seɪ ðat juː njuː wɒt sɪŋɪŋ wɒz.
101212|06-000062|"I sing a little myself," he said;| "aɪ sɪŋ eɪ lɪtəl maɪsɛlf," hiː sɛd;
101213|06-000063|some day I will show you.|sʌm deɪ aɪ wɪl ʃəʊ juː.
101214|06-000064|Not to-day, but some other time.|nɒt tədeɪ, bʌt sʌm ʌðə taɪm.
101215|06-000065|And then he got up to go;|and ðɛn hiː ɡɒt ʌp tuː ɡəʊ;
101217|06-000067|He thought of this after he got into the street;|hiː θɔːt ɒv ðɪs aftə hiː ɡɒt ɪntʊ ðə stɹiːt;
101218|06-000068|but he might have spared his compunction, for Catherine had not noticed the lapse.|bʌt hiː maɪt hav speəd hɪz kəmpʌŋkʃən, fɔː kaθɹɪn had nɒt nəʊtɪst ðə laps.
101219|06-000069|She was thinking only that "some other time" had a delightful sound;|ʃiː wɒz θɪŋkɪŋ əʊnli ðat "sʌm ʌðə taɪm" had eɪ dɪlaɪtfəl saʊnd;
101220|06-000070|it seemed to spread itself over the future.|ɪt siːmd tuː spɹɛd ɪtsɛlf əʊvə ðə fjuːtʃə.
101221|06-000071|This was all the more reason, however, though she was ashamed and uncomfortable, why she should tell her father that mister Morris Townsend had called again.|ðɪs wɒz ɔːl ðə mɔː ɹiːzən, haʊɛvə, ðəʊ ʃiː wɒz ɐʃeɪmd and ʌŋkʌmftəbəl, waɪ ʃiː ʃʊd tɛl hɜː fɑːðə ðat mɪstə mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd had kɔːld ɐɡɛn.
101222|06-000072|She announced the fact abruptly, almost violently, as soon as the Doctor came into the house;|ʃiː ɐnaʊnst ðə fakt ɐbɹʌptli, ɔːlməʊst vaɪələntli, az suːn az ðə dɒktə keɪm ɪntʊ ðə haʊs;
101223|06-000073|and having done so -- it was her duty -- she took measures to leave the room.|and havɪŋ dʌn səʊ -- ɪt wɒz hɜː djuːti -- ʃiː tʊk mɛʒəz tuː liːv ðə ɹuːm.
101224|06-000074|But she could not leave it fast enough;|bʌt ʃiː kʊd nɒt liːv ɪt fast ɪnʌf;
101225|06-000075|her father stopped her just as she reached the door.|hɜː fɑːðə stɒpt hɜː dʒʌst az ʃiː ɹiːtʃt ðə dɔː.
101226|06-000076|"Well, my dear, did he propose to you to-day?" the Doctor asked.| "wɛl, maɪ diə, dɪd hiː pɹəpəʊz tuː juː tədeɪ?" ðə dɒktə askt.
101227|06-000077|This was just what she had been afraid he would say;|ðɪs wɒz dʒʌst wɒt ʃiː had biːn ɐfɹeɪd hiː wʊd seɪ;
101228|06-000078|and yet she had no answer ready.|and jɛt ʃiː had nəʊ ansə ɹɛdi.
101229|06-000079|Of course she would have liked to take it as a joke -- as her father must have meant it;|ɒv kɔːs ʃiː wʊd hav laɪkt tuː teɪk ɪt az eɪ dʒəʊk -- az hɜː fɑːðə mʌst hav mɛnt ɪt;
101230|06-000080|and yet she would have liked, also, in denying it, to be a little positive, a little sharp;|and jɛt ʃiː wʊd hav laɪkt, ɔːlsəʊ, ɪn dɪnaɪɪŋ ɪt, tuː biː eɪ lɪtəl pɒzɪtɪv, eɪ lɪtəl ʃɑːp;
101231|06-000081|so that he would perhaps not ask the question again.|səʊ ðat hiː wʊd pəhaps nɒt ask ðə kwɛstʃən ɐɡɛn.
101232|06-000082|She didn't like it -- it made her unhappy.|ʃiː dɪdnt laɪk ɪt -- ɪt meɪd hɜː ʌnhapi.
101233|06-000083|But Catherine could never be sharp;|bʌt kaθɹɪn kʊd nɛvə biː ʃɑːp;
101234|06-000084|and for a moment she only stood, with her hand on the door-knob, looking at her satiric parent, and giving a little laugh.|and fɔː eɪ məʊmənt ʃiː əʊnli stʊd, wɪð hɜː hand ɒn ðə dɔːnɒb, lʊkɪŋ at hɜː sɐtɪɹɪk peəɹənt, and ɡɪvɪŋ eɪ lɪtəl laf.
101235|06-000085|"Decidedly," said the Doctor to himself, "my daughter is not brilliant."| "dɪsaɪdɪdli," sɛd ðə dɒktə tuː hɪmsɛlf, "maɪ dɔːtə ɪz nɒt bɹɪliənt."
101236|06-000086|But he had no sooner made this reflexion than Catherine found something;|bʌt hiː had nəʊ suːnə meɪd ðɪs ɹiːflɛksiən ðɐn kaθɹɪn faʊnd sʌmθɪŋ;
101237|06-000087|she had decided, on the whole, to take the thing as a joke.|ʃiː had dɪsaɪdɪd, ɒn ðə həʊl, tuː teɪk ðə θɪŋ az eɪ dʒəʊk.
101239|06-000089|And she quickly got out of the room.|and ʃiː kwɪkli ɡɒt aʊt ɒv ðə ɹuːm.
101240|06-000090|The Doctor stood staring;|ðə dɒktə stʊd steəɹɪŋ;
101241|06-000091|he wondered whether his daughter were serious.|hiː wʌndəd wɛðə hɪz dɔːtə wɜː siəɹiəs.
101243|06-000093|She almost wished, now, that her father would ask his question again, so that she might reply: "Oh yes, mister Morris Townsend proposed to me, and I refused him!"|ʃiː ɔːlməʊst wɪʃt, naʊ, ðat hɜː fɑːðə wʊd ask hɪz kwɛstʃən ɐɡɛn, səʊ ðat ʃiː maɪt ɹɪplaɪ: "əʊ jɛs, mɪstə mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd pɹəpəʊzd tuː miː, and aɪ ɹɪfjuːzd hɪm!"
101244|06-000094|The Doctor, however, began to put his questions elsewhere;|ðə dɒktə, haʊɛvə, bɪɡan tuː pʊt hɪz kwɛstʃənz ɛlsweə;
101246|06-000096|He addressed himself to the younger of his sisters, misess Almond -- not going to her for the purpose;|hiː ɐdɹɛst hɪmsɛlf tuː ðə jʌŋɡə ɒv hɪz sɪstəz, mɪsɛs ɒlmənd -- nɒt ɡəʊɪŋ tuː hɜː fɔː ðə pɜːpəs;
101247|06-000097|there was no such hurry as that -- but having made a note of the matter for the first opportunity.|ðeə wɒz nəʊ sʌtʃ hʌɹi az ðat -- bʌt havɪŋ meɪd eɪ nəʊt ɒv ðə matə fɔː ðə fɜːst ɒpətjuːnɪti.

101249|06-000099|but he made notes of everything, and he regularly consulted his notes.|bʌt hiː meɪd nəʊts ɒv ɛvɹɪθɪŋ, and hiː ɹɛɡjʊləli kənsʌltɪd hɪz nəʊts.
101250|06-000100|Among them the information he obtained from misess Almond about Morris Townsend took its place.|ɐmʌŋ ðɛm ðə ɪnfəmeɪʃən hiː ɒbteɪnd fɹɒm mɪsɛs ɒlmənd ɐbaʊt mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd tʊk ɪts pleɪs.

101253|06-000103|I don't understand it.|aɪ dəʊnt ʌndəstand ɪt.
101254|06-000104|It's not, after all, Lavinia that the young man is supposed to have designs upon.|ɪts nɒt, aftə ɔːl, lavɪniə ðat ðə jʌŋ man ɪz səpəʊzd tuː hav dɪzaɪnz əpɒn.
101255|06-000105|She is very peculiar.|ʃiː ɪz vɛɹi pɪkjuːliə.
101256|06-000106|"Ah, my dear," the Doctor replied, "she has not lived with me these twelve years without my finding it out!"| "ɑː, maɪ diə," ðə dɒktə ɹɪplaɪd, "ʃiː haz nɒt lɪvd wɪð miː ðiːz twɛlv jiəz wɪðaʊt maɪ faɪndɪŋ ɪt aʊt!"
101257|06-000107|"She has got such an artificial mind," said misess Almond, who always enjoyed an opportunity to discuss Lavinia's peculiarities with her brother.| "ʃiː haz ɡɒt sʌtʃ an ɑːtɪfɪʃəl maɪnd," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd, huː ɔːlweɪz ɛndʒɔɪd an ɒpətjuːnɪti tuː dɪskʌs lavɪniəz pɪkjuːliaɹɪtiz wɪð hɜː bɹʌðə.

101259|06-000109|but I told her I would.|bʌt aɪ təʊld hɜː aɪ wʊd.
101260|06-000110|She always wants to conceal everything.|ʃiː ɔːlweɪz wɒnts tuː kənsiːl ɛvɹɪθɪŋ.

101262|06-000112|She is like a revolving lighthouse;|ʃiː ɪz laɪk eɪ ɹɪvɒlvɪŋ laɪthaʊs;

101264|06-000114|"But what did you tell her?" the Doctor asked.| "bʌt wɒt dɪd juː tɛl hɜː?" ðə dɒktə askt.
101265|06-000115|What I tell you;|wɒt aɪ tɛl juː;

101268|06-000118|she would prefer him to have been guilty of some romantic crime.|ʃiː wʊd pɹɪfɜː hɪm tuː hav biːn ɡɪlti ɒv sʌm ɹəʊmantɪk kɹaɪm.

101300|06-000150|He has lately come back to America, with the intention, as he tells Arthur, of beginning life in earnest.|hiː haz leɪtli kʌm bak tuː ɐmɛɹɪkə, wɪð ðə ɪntɛnʃən, az hiː tɛlz ɑːθə, ɒv bɪɡɪnɪŋ laɪf ɪn ɜːnɪst.
101301|06-000151|Is he in earnest about Catherine, then?|ɪz hiː ɪn ɜːnɪst ɐbaʊt kaθɹɪn, ðɛn?
101302|06-000152|"I don't see why you should be incredulous," said misess Almond.| "aɪ dəʊnt siː waɪ juː ʃʊd biː ɪŋkɹɛdjʊləs," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd.
101303|06-000153|It seems to me that you have never done Catherine justice.|ɪt siːmz tuː miː ðat juː hav nɛvə dʌn kaθɹɪn dʒʌstɪs.

101305|06-000155|The Doctor looked at his sister a moment, and then, with the slightest touch of bitterness: "You at least appreciate her," he said.|ðə dɒktə lʊkt at hɪz sɪstə eɪ məʊmənt, and ðɛn, wɪð ðə slaɪtɪst tʌtʃ ɒv bɪtənəs: "juː at liːst ɐpɹiːʃɪeɪt hɜː," hiː sɛd.
101306|06-000156|misess Almond blushed.|mɪsɛs ɒlmənd blʌʃt.
101307|06-000157|I don't mean that is her only merit;|aɪ dəʊnt miːn ðat ɪz hɜː əʊnli mɛɹɪt;
101308|06-000158|I simply mean that it is a great one.|aɪ sɪmpli miːn ðat ɪt ɪz eɪ ɡɹeɪt wɒn.
101309|06-000159|A great many young men think so;|eɪ ɡɹeɪt mɛni jʌŋ mɛn θɪŋk səʊ;
101310|06-000160|and you appear to me never to have been properly aware of that.|and juː ɐpiə tuː miː nɛvə tuː hav biːn pɹɒpəli ɐweə ɒv ðat.
101311|06-000161|You have always had a little way of alluding to her as an unmarriageable girl.|juː hav ɔːlweɪz had eɪ lɪtəl weɪ ɒv ɐluːdɪŋ tuː hɜː az an ʌnmaɹɪdʒəbəl ɡɜːl.
101312|06-000162|"My allusions are as kind as yours, Elizabeth," said the Doctor frankly.| "maɪ ɐluːʒənz ɑː az kaɪnd az jɔːz, ɪlɪzəbəθ," sɛd ðə dɒktə fɹaŋkli.
101313|06-000163|How many suitors has Catherine had, with all her expectations -- how much attention has she ever received?|haʊ mɛni suːtəz haz kaθɹɪn had, wɪð ɔːl hɜː ɛkspɪkteɪʃənz -- haʊ mʌtʃ ɐtɛnʃən haz ʃiː ɛvə ɹɪsiːvd?
101314|06-000164|Catherine is not unmarriageable, but she is absolutely unattractive.|kaθɹɪn ɪz nɒt ʌnmaɹɪdʒəbəl, bʌt ʃiː ɪz absəluːtli ʌnɐtɹaktɪv.
101315|06-000165|What other reason is there for Lavinia being so charmed with the idea that there is a lover in the house?|wɒt ʌðə ɹiːzən ɪz ðeə fɔː lavɪniə biːɪŋ səʊ tʃɑːmd wɪð ðə aɪdiə ðat ðeə ɪz eɪ lʌvə ɪn ðə haʊs?
101316|06-000166|There has never been one before, and Lavinia, with her sensitive, sympathetic nature, is not used to the idea.|ðeə haz nɛvə biːn wɒn bɪfɔː, and lavɪniə, wɪð hɜː sɛnsɪtɪv, sɪmpəθɛtɪk neɪtʃə, ɪz nɒt juːzd tuː ðə aɪdiə.
101317|06-000167|It affects her imagination.|ɪt ɐfɛkts hɜː ɪmadʒɪneɪʃən.
101318|06-000168|I must do the young men of New York the justice to say that they strike me as very disinterested.|aɪ mʌst duː ðə jʌŋ mɛn ɒv njuː jɔːk ðə dʒʌstɪs tuː seɪ ðat ðeɪ stɹaɪk miː az vɛɹi dɪsɪntɹɪstɪd.
101319|06-000169|They prefer pretty girls -- lively girls -- girls like your own.|ðeɪ pɹɪfɜː pɹɪti ɡɜːlz -- laɪvlɪ ɡɜːlz -- ɡɜːlz laɪk jɔː əʊn.
101320|06-000170|Catherine is neither pretty nor lively.|kaθɹɪn ɪz naɪðə pɹɪti nɔː laɪvlɪ.
101321|06-000171|Catherine does very well;|kaθɹɪn dʌz vɛɹi wɛl;
101322|06-000172|"she has a style of her own -- which is more than my poor Marian has, who has no style at all," said misess Almond.| "ʃiː haz eɪ staɪl ɒv hɜː əʊn -- wɪtʃ ɪz mɔː ðɐn maɪ pʊə maɹiən haz, huː haz nəʊ staɪl at ɔːl," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd.
101323|06-000173|The reason Catherine has received so little attention is that she seems to all the young men to be older than themselves.|ðə ɹiːzən kaθɹɪn haz ɹɪsiːvd səʊ lɪtəl ɐtɛnʃən ɪz ðat ʃiː siːmz tuː ɔːl ðə jʌŋ mɛn tuː biː əʊldə ðɐn ðɛmsɛlvz.

101325|06-000175|They are rather afraid of her, I think;|ðeɪ ɑː ɹɑːðə ɐfɹeɪd ɒv hɜː, aɪ θɪŋk;
101326|06-000176|she looks as if she had been married already, and you know they don't like married women.|ʃiː lʊks az ɪf ʃiː had biːn maɹid ɔːlɹɛdi, and juː nəʊ ðeɪ dəʊnt laɪk maɹid wɪmɪn.
101327|06-000177|"And if our young men appear disinterested," the Doctor's wiser sister went on, "it is because they marry, as a general thing, so young;"| "and ɪf aʊə jʌŋ mɛn ɐpiə dɪsɪntɹɪstɪd," ðə dɒktəz waɪzə sɪstə wɛnt ɒn, "ɪt ɪz bɪkɒz ðeɪ maɹi, az eɪ dʒɛnəɹəl θɪŋ, səʊ jʌŋ;"

101330|06-000180|As a calculation?|az eɪ kalkjʊleɪʃən?
101331|06-000181|"Thank you very much," said the Doctor.| "θaŋk juː vɛɹi mʌtʃ," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
101332|06-000182|"Wait till some intelligent man of forty comes along, and he will be delighted with Catherine," misess Almond continued.| "weɪt tɪl sʌm ɪntɛlɪdʒənt man ɒv fɔːti kʌmz ɐlɒŋ, and hiː wɪl biː dɪlaɪtɪd wɪð kaθɹɪn," mɪsɛs ɒlmənd kəntɪnjuːd.
101333|06-000183|mister Townsend is not old enough, then;|mɪstə taʊnsɛnd ɪz nɒt əʊld ɪnʌf, ðɛn;
101334|06-000184|his motives may be pure.|hɪz məʊtɪvz meɪ biː pjʊə.

101337|06-000187|Lavinia is sure of it, and, as he is a very prepossessing youth, you might give him the benefit of the doubt.|lavɪniə ɪz ʃʊə ɒv ɪt, and, az hiː ɪz eɪ vɛɹi pɹɪpəzɛsɪŋ juːθ, juː maɪt ɡɪv hɪm ðə bɛnɪfɪt ɒv ðə daʊt.
101338|06-000188|doctor Sloper reflected a moment.|dɒktə sləʊpə ɹɪflɛktɪd eɪ məʊmənt.
101339|06-000189|What are his present means of subsistence?|wɒt ɑː hɪz pɹɛzənt miːnz ɒv sʌbsɪstəns?
101340|06-000190|I have no idea.|aɪ hav nəʊ aɪdiə.
101341|06-000191|He lives, as I say, with his sister.|hiː laɪvz, az aɪ seɪ, wɪð hɪz sɪstə.
101342|06-000192|A widow, with five children?|eɪ wɪdəʊ, wɪð faɪv tʃɪldɹən?
101343|06-000193|Do you mean he lives upon her?|duː juː miːn hiː laɪvz əpɒn hɜː?
101344|06-000194|misess Almond got up, and with a certain impatience: "Had you not better ask misess Montgomery herself?" she inquired.|mɪsɛs ɒlmənd ɡɒt ʌp, and wɪð eɪ sɜːtən ɪmpeɪʃəns: "had juː nɒt bɛtə ask mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi hɜːsɛlf?" ʃiː ɪŋkwaɪəd.
101345|06-000195|"Perhaps I may come to that," said the Doctor.| "pəhaps aɪ meɪ kʌm tuː ðat," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
101346|06-000196|Did you say the Second Avenue?|dɪd juː seɪ ðə sɛkənd avənjuː?
101347|07-000001|he was, however, by no means so much in earnest as this might seem to indicate;|hiː wɒz, haʊɛvə, baɪ nəʊ miːnz səʊ mʌtʃ ɪn ɜːnɪst az ðɪs maɪt siːm tuː ɪndɪkeɪt;
101348|07-000002|and, indeed, he was more than anything else amused with the whole situation.|and, ɪndiːd, hiː wɒz mɔː ðɐn ɛnɪθɪŋ ɛls ɐmjuːzd wɪð ðə həʊl sɪtʃuːeɪʃən.
101349|07-000003|He was not in the least in a state of tension or of vigilance with regard to Catherine's prospects;|hiː wɒz nɒt ɪn ðə liːst ɪn eɪ steɪt ɒv tɛnʃən ɔː ɒv vɪdʒɪləns wɪð ɹɪɡɑːd tuː kaθɹɪnz pɹɒspɛkts;
101350|07-000004|he was even on his guard against the ridicule that might attach itself to the spectacle of a house thrown into agitation by its daughter and heiress receiving attentions unprecedented in its annals.|hiː wɒz iːvən ɒn hɪz ɡɑːd ɐɡɛnst ðə ɹɪdɪkjuːl ðat maɪt ɐtatʃ ɪtsɛlf tuː ðə spɛktəkəl ɒv eɪ haʊs θɹəʊn ɪntʊ adʒɪteɪʃən baɪ ɪts dɔːtə and eəɹɛs ɹɪsiːvɪŋ ɐtɛnʃənz ʌnpɹɛsɪdəntɪd ɪn ɪts anəlz.
101351|07-000005|More than this, he went so far as to promise himself some entertainment from the little drama -- if drama it was -- of which misess Penniman desired to represent the ingenious mister Townsend as the hero.|mɔː ðɐn ðɪs, hiː wɛnt səʊ fɑː az tuː pɹɒmɪs hɪmsɛlf sʌm ɛntəteɪnmənt fɹɒm ðə lɪtəl dɹɑːmə -- ɪf dɹɑːmə ɪt wɒz -- ɒv wɪtʃ mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən dɪzaɪəd tuː ɹɛpɹɪzɛnt ðə ɪndʒiːniəs mɪstə taʊnsɛnd az ðə hiəɹəʊ.
101352|07-000006|He had no intention, as yet, of regulating the denouement.|hiː had nəʊ ɪntɛnʃən, az jɛt, ɒv ɹɛɡjʊleɪtɪŋ ðə deɪnuːmɔ̃.
101353|07-000007|He was perfectly willing, as Elizabeth had suggested, to give the young man the benefit of every doubt.|hiː wɒz pɜːfɛktlɪ wɪlɪŋ, az ɪlɪzəbəθ had sədʒɛstɪd, tuː ɡɪv ðə jʌŋ man ðə bɛnɪfɪt ɒv ɛvɹɪ daʊt.
101354|07-000008|There was no great danger in it;|ðeə wɒz nəʊ ɡɹeɪt deɪndʒə ɪn ɪt;
101355|07-000009|for Catherine, at the age of twenty-two, was, after all, a rather mature blossom, such as could be plucked from the stem only by a vigorous jerk.|fɔː kaθɹɪn, at ðə eɪdʒ ɒv twɛntɪtuː, wɒz, aftə ɔːl, eɪ ɹɑːðə mətʃʊə blɒsəm, sʌtʃ az kʊd biː plʌkt fɹɒm ðə stɛm əʊnli baɪ eɪ vɪɡəɹəs dʒɜːk.
101356|07-000010|The fact that Morris Townsend was poor -- was not of necessity against him;|ðə fakt ðat mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd wɒz pʊə -- wɒz nɒt ɒv nəsɛsɪti ɐɡɛnst hɪm;
101357|07-000011|the Doctor had never made up his mind that his daughter should marry a rich man.|ðə dɒktə had nɛvə meɪd ʌp hɪz maɪnd ðat hɪz dɔːtə ʃʊd maɹi eɪ ɹɪtʃ man.
101359|07-000013|There were other things besides.|ðeə wɜː ʌðə θɪŋz bɪsaɪdz.
101360|07-000014|The Doctor thought it very vulgar to be precipitate in accusing people of mercenary motives, inasmuch as his door had as yet not been in the least besieged by fortune-hunters;|ðə dɒktə θɔːt ɪt vɛɹi vʌlɡə tuː biː pɹɪsɪpɪteɪt ɪn ɐkjuːzɪŋ piːpəl ɒv mɜːsənəɹi məʊtɪvz, ɪnɐsmʌtʃ az hɪz dɔː had az jɛt nɒt biːn ɪn ðə liːst bɪsiːdʒd baɪ fɔːtʃuːnhʌntəz;
101361|07-000015|and, lastly, he was very curious to see whether Catherine might really be loved for her moral worth.|and, lastli, hiː wɒz vɛɹi kjʊəɹiəs tuː siː wɛðə kaθɹɪn maɪt ɹiəlɪ biː lʌvd fɔː hɜː mɒɹəl wɜːθ.
101362|07-000016|He smiled as he reflected that poor mister Townsend had been only twice to the house, and he said to misess Penniman that the next time he should come she must ask him to dinner.|hiː smaɪld az hiː ɹɪflɛktɪd ðat pʊə mɪstə taʊnsɛnd had biːn əʊnli twaɪs tuː ðə haʊs, and hiː sɛd tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ðat ðə nɛkst taɪm hiː ʃʊd kʌm ʃiː mʌst ask hɪm tuː dɪnə.
101363|07-000017|He came very soon again, and misess Penniman had of course great pleasure in executing this mission.|hiː keɪm vɛɹi suːn ɐɡɛn, and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had ɒv kɔːs ɡɹeɪt plɛʒə ɪn ɛksɪkjuːtɪŋ ðɪs mɪʃən.
101365|07-000019|The Doctor had said to himself, justly enough, that they must not have the young man alone;|ðə dɒktə had sɛd tuː hɪmsɛlf, dʒʌstli ɪnʌf, ðat ðeɪ mʌst nɒt hav ðə jʌŋ man ɐləʊn;
101366|07-000020|this would partake too much of the nature of encouragement.|ðɪs wʊd pɑːteɪk tuː mʌtʃ ɒv ðə neɪtʃə ɒv ɛŋkʌɹɪdʒmənt.
101367|07-000021|So two or three other persons were invited;|səʊ tuː ɔː θɹiː ʌðə pɜːsənz wɜː ɪnvaɪtɪd;
101368|07-000022|but Morris Townsend, though he was by no means the ostensible, was the real, occasion of the feast.|bʌt mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd, ðəʊ hiː wɒz baɪ nəʊ miːnz ðə ɒstɛnsɪbəl, wɒz ðə ɹiəl, əkeɪʒən ɒv ðə fiːst.
101369|07-000023|There is every reason to suppose that he desired to make a good impression;|ðeə ɪz ɛvɹɪ ɹiːzən tuː səpəʊz ðat hiː dɪzaɪəd tuː meɪk eɪ ɡʊd ɪmpɹɛʃən;
101371|07-000025|The Doctor talked to him very little during dinner;|ðə dɒktə tɔːkt tuː hɪm vɛɹi lɪtəl djʊəɹɪŋ dɪnə;
101372|07-000026|but he observed him attentively, and after the ladies had gone out he pushed him the wine and asked him several questions.|bʌt hiː ɒbzɜːvd hɪm ɐtɛntɪvli, and aftə ðə leɪdiz had ɡɒn aʊt hiː pʊʃt hɪm ðə waɪn and askt hɪm sɛvɹəl kwɛstʃənz.
101373|07-000027|Morris was not a young man who needed to be pressed, and he found quite enough encouragement in the superior quality of the claret.|mɒɹɪs wɒz nɒt eɪ jʌŋ man huː niːdɪd tuː biː pɹɛst, and hiː faʊnd kwaɪt ɪnʌf ɛŋkʌɹɪdʒmənt ɪn ðə suːpiəɹɪə kwɒlɪti ɒv ðə klaɹət.
101374|07-000028|The Doctor's wine was admirable, and it may be communicated to the reader that while he sipped it Morris reflected that a cellar-full of good liquor -- there was evidently a cellar-full here -- would be a most attractive idiosyncrasy in a father-in-law.|ðə dɒktəz waɪn wɒz admɪɹəbəl, and ɪt meɪ biː kəmjuːnɪkeɪtɪd tuː ðə ɹiːdə ðat waɪl hiː sɪpt ɪt mɒɹɪs ɹɪflɛktɪd ðat eɪ sɛlɑːfʊl ɒv ɡʊd lɪkə -- ðeə wɒz ɛvɪdəntli eɪ sɛlɑːfʊl hiə -- wʊd biː eɪ məʊst ɐtɹaktɪv ɪdɪɒsɪŋkɹəsi ɪn eɪ fɑːðəɹɪnlɔː.
101375|07-000029|The Doctor was struck with his appreciative guest;|ðə dɒktə wɒz stɹʌk wɪð hɪz ɐpɹiːʃiətɪv ɡɛst;
101376|07-000030|he saw that he was not a commonplace young man.|hiː sɔː ðat hiː wɒz nɒt eɪ kɒmənpleɪs jʌŋ man.

101381|07-000035|But I don't think I like him.|bʌt aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk aɪ laɪk hɪm.
101383|07-000037|doctor Sloper had travelled but little, and he took the liberty of not believing everything this anecdotical idler narrated.|dɒktə sləʊpə had tɹavəld bʌt lɪtəl, and hiː tʊk ðə lɪbəti ɒv nɒt bɪliːvɪŋ ɛvɹɪθɪŋ ðɪs anɪkdəʊtɪkəl aɪdlə nɐɹeɪtɪd.
101384|07-000038|He prided himself on being something of a physiognomist, and while the young man, chatting with easy assurance, puffed his cigar and filled his glass again, the Doctor sat with his eyes quietly fixed on his bright, expressive face.|hiː pɹaɪdɪd hɪmsɛlf ɒn biːɪŋ sʌmθɪŋ ɒv eɪ fɪzɪɒɡnəmɪst, and waɪl ðə jʌŋ man, tʃatɪŋ wɪð iːzi əʃʊəɹəns, pʌft hɪz sɪɡɑː and fɪld hɪz ɡlas ɐɡɛn, ðə dɒktə sat wɪð hɪz aɪz kwaɪətli fɪkst ɒn hɪz bɹaɪt, ɛkspɹɛsɪv feɪs.

101392|07-000046|After dinner Morris Townsend went and stood before Catherine, who was standing before the fire in her red satin gown.|aftə dɪnə mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd wɛnt and stʊd bɪfɔː kaθɹɪn, huː wɒz standɪŋ bɪfɔː ðə faɪə ɪn hɜː ɹɛd satɪn ɡaʊn.

101398|07-000052|I feel;|aɪ fiːl;
101399|07-000053|I am very quick to feel.|aɪ am vɛɹi kwɪk tuː fiːl.
101400|07-000054|Perhaps you are mistaken.|pəhaps juː ɑː mɪsteɪkən.
101401|07-000055|Ah, well;|ɑː, wɛl;
101402|07-000056|you ask him and you will see.|juː ask hɪm and juː wɪl siː.
101403|07-000057|I would rather not ask him, if there is any danger of his saying what you think.|aɪ wʊd ɹɑːðə nɒt ask hɪm, ɪf ðeə ɪz ɛni deɪndʒə ɒv hɪz seɪɪŋ wɒt juː θɪŋk.
101404|07-000058|Morris looked at her with an air of mock melancholy.|mɒɹɪs lʊkt at hɜː wɪð an eə ɒv mɒk mɛləŋkɒli.
101405|07-000059|It wouldn't give you any pleasure to contradict him?|ɪt wʊdnt ɡɪv juː ɛni plɛʒə tuː kɒntɹədɪkt hɪm?
101406|07-000060|"I never contradict him," said Catherine.| "aɪ nɛvə kɒntɹədɪkt hɪm," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
101407|07-000061|Will you hear me abused without opening your lips in my defence?|wɪl juː hiə miː ɐbjuːzd wɪðaʊt əʊpənɪŋ jɔː lɪps ɪn maɪ dɪfɛns?
101408|07-000062|My father won't abuse you.|maɪ fɑːðə wɒnt ɐbjuːs juː.
101409|07-000063|He doesn't know you enough.|hiː dʌzənt nəʊ juː ɪnʌf.
101410|07-000064|Morris Townsend gave a loud laugh, and Catherine began to blush again.|mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd ɡeɪv eɪ laʊd laf, and kaθɹɪn bɪɡan tuː blʌʃ ɐɡɛn.
101411|07-000065|"I shall never mention you," she said, to take refuge from her confusion.| "aɪ ʃal nɛvə mɛnʃən juː," ʃiː sɛd, tuː teɪk ɹɛfjuːdʒ fɹɒm hɜː kənfjuːʒən.
101412|07-000066|That is very well;|ðat ɪz vɛɹi wɛl;
101413|07-000067|but it is not quite what I should have liked you to say.|bʌt ɪt ɪz nɒt kwaɪt wɒt aɪ ʃʊd hav laɪkt juː tuː seɪ.
101415|07-000069|Ah, but it would matter;|ɑː, bʌt ɪt wʊd matə;
101416|07-000070|"I couldn't say that!" the girl exclaimed.| "aɪ kʊdnt seɪ ðat!" ðə ɡɜːl ɛkskleɪmd.
101417|07-000071|He looked at her for a moment, smiling a little;|hiː lʊkt at hɜː fɔː eɪ məʊmənt, smaɪlɪŋ eɪ lɪtəl;
101418|07-000072|and the Doctor, if he had been watching him just then, would have seen a gleam of fine impatience in the sociable softness of his eye.|and ðə dɒktə, ɪf hiː had biːn wɒtʃɪŋ hɪm dʒʌst ðɛn, wʊd hav siːn eɪ ɡliːm ɒv faɪn ɪmpeɪʃəns ɪn ðə səʊʃiəbəl sɒftnəs ɒv hɪz aɪ.
101419|07-000073|But there was no impatience in his rejoinder -- none, at least, save what was expressed in a little appealing sigh.|bʌt ðeə wɒz nəʊ ɪmpeɪʃəns ɪn hɪz ɹɪdʒɔɪndə -- nʌn, at liːst, seɪv wɒt wɒz ɛkspɹɛst ɪn eɪ lɪtəl ɐpiːlɪŋ saɪ.
101420|07-000074|Ah, well, then, I must not give up the hope of bringing him round!|ɑː, wɛl, ðɛn, aɪ mʌst nɒt ɡɪv ʌp ðə həʊp ɒv bɹɪŋɪŋ hɪm ɹaʊnd!
101421|07-000075|He expressed it more frankly to misess Penniman later in the evening.|hiː ɛkspɹɛst ɪt mɔː fɹaŋkli tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən leɪtə ɪn ðə iːvnɪŋ.
101422|07-000076|But before that he sang two or three songs at Catherine's timid request;|bʌt bɪfɔː ðat hiː saŋ tuː ɔː θɹiː sɒŋz at kaθɹɪnz tɪmɪd ɹɪkwɛst;
101423|07-000077|not that he flattered himself that this would help to bring her father round.|nɒt ðat hiː flatəd hɪmsɛlf ðat ðɪs wʊd hɛlp tuː bɹɪŋ hɜː fɑːðə ɹaʊnd.
101424|07-000078|He had a sweet, light tenor voice, and when he had finished every one made some exclamation -- every one, that is, save Catherine, who remained intensely silent.|hiː had eɪ swiːt, laɪt tɛnə vɔɪs, and wɛn hiː had fɪnɪʃt ɛvɹɪ wɒn meɪd sʌm ɛksklɐmeɪʃən -- ɛvɹɪ wɒn, ðat ɪz, seɪv kaθɹɪn, huː ɹɪmeɪnd ɪntɛnsli saɪlənt.
101425|07-000079|misess Penniman declared that his manner of singing was "most artistic," and doctor Sloper said it was "very taking -- very taking indeed";|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən dɪkleəd ðat hɪz manə ɒv sɪŋɪŋ wɒz "məʊst ɑːtɪstɪk," and dɒktə sləʊpə sɛd ɪt wɒz "vɛɹi teɪkɪŋ -- vɛɹi teɪkɪŋ ɪndiːd";
101426|07-000080|speaking loudly and distinctly, but with a certain dryness.|spiːkɪŋ laʊdli and dɪstɪŋktli, bʌt wɪð eɪ sɜːtən dɹaɪnəs.
101427|07-000081|"He doesn't like me -- he doesn't like me at all," said Morris Townsend, addressing the aunt in the same manner as he had done the niece.| "hiː dʌzənt laɪk miː -- hiː dʌzənt laɪk miː at ɔːl," sɛd mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd, ɐdɹɛsɪŋ ðə ant ɪn ðə seɪm manə az hiː had dʌn ðə niːs.
101428|07-000082|He thinks I'm all wrong.|hiː θɪŋks ɪm ɔːl ɹɒŋ.
101429|07-000083|Unlike her niece, misess Penniman asked for no explanation.|ʌnlaɪk hɜː niːs, mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən askt fɔː nəʊ ɛksplɐneɪʃən.
101430|07-000084|She only smiled very sweetly, as if she understood everything;|ʃiː əʊnli smaɪld vɛɹi swiːtli, az ɪf ʃiː ʌndəstʊd ɛvɹɪθɪŋ;
101431|07-000085|and, unlike Catherine too, she made no attempt to contradict him.|and, ʌnlaɪk kaθɹɪn tuː, ʃiː meɪd nəʊ ɐtɛmpt tuː kɒntɹədɪkt hɪm.
101432|07-000086|"Pray, what does it matter?" she murmured softly.| "pɹeɪ, wɒt dʌz ɪt matə?" ʃiː mɜːməd sɒftli.
101433|07-000087|"Ah, you say the right thing!" said Morris, greatly to the gratification of misess Penniman, who prided herself on always saying the right thing.| "ɑː, juː seɪ ðə ɹaɪt θɪŋ!" sɛd mɒɹɪs, ɡɹeɪtli tuː ðə ɡɹatɪfɪkeɪʃən ɒv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː pɹaɪdɪd hɜːsɛlf ɒn ɔːlweɪz seɪɪŋ ðə ɹaɪt θɪŋ.
101434|07-000088|The Doctor, the next time he saw his sister Elizabeth, let her know that he had made the acquaintance of Lavinia's protege.|ðə dɒktə, ðə nɛkst taɪm hiː sɔː hɪz sɪstə ɪlɪzəbəθ, lɛt hɜː nəʊ ðat hiː had meɪd ðə ɐkweɪntəns ɒv lavɪniəz pɹɒtəʒeɪ.

101436|07-000090|As an anatomist, it is really a pleasure to me to see such a beautiful structure;|az an anɐtəmɪst, ɪt ɪz ɹiəlɪ eɪ plɛʒə tuː miː tuː siː sʌtʃ eɪ bjuːtifəl stɹʌktʃə;
101437|07-000091|although, if people were all like him, I suppose there would be very little need for doctors.|ɔːlðəʊ, ɪf piːpəl wɜː ɔːl laɪk hɪm, aɪ səpəʊz ðeə wʊd biː vɛɹi lɪtəl niːd fɔː dɒktəz.
101438|07-000092|"Don't you see anything in people but their bones?" misess Almond rejoined.| "dəʊnt juː siː ɛnɪθɪŋ ɪn piːpəl bʌt ðeə bəʊnz?" mɪsɛs ɒlmənd ɹɪdʒɔɪnd.
101439|07-000093|What do you think of him as a father?|wɒt duː juː θɪŋk ɒv hɪm az eɪ fɑːðə?
101440|07-000094|As a father?|az eɪ fɑːðə?

101442|07-000096|No;|nəʊ;
101443|07-000097|but you are Catherine's.|bʌt juː ɑː kaθɹɪnz.

101445|07-000099|She must get over it.|ʃiː mʌst ɡɛt əʊvə ɪt.
101446|07-000100|He is not a gentleman.|hiː ɪz nɒt eɪ dʒɛntəlmən.
101447|07-000101|Ah, take care!|ɑː, teɪk keə!
101448|07-000102|Remember that he is a branch of the Townsends.|ɹɪmɛmbə ðat hiː ɪz eɪ bɹantʃ ɒv ðə taʊnsɛndz.
101449|07-000103|He is not what I call a gentleman.|hiː ɪz nɒt wɒt aɪ kɔːl eɪ dʒɛntəlmən.
101450|07-000104|He has not the soul of one.|hiː haz nɒt ðə səʊl ɒv wɒn.
101451|07-000105|He is extremely insinuating;|hiː ɪz ɛkstɹiːmli ɪnsɪnjuːeɪtɪŋ;
101452|07-000106|but it's a vulgar nature.|bʌt ɪts eɪ vʌlɡə neɪtʃə.
101453|07-000107|I saw through it in a minute.|aɪ sɔː θɹuː ɪt ɪn eɪ mɪnɪt.
101454|07-000108|He is altogether too familiar -- I hate familiarity.|hiː ɪz ɔːltəɡɛðə tuː fəmɪliə -- aɪ heɪt fəmɪliaɹɪti.
101455|07-000109|He is a plausible coxcomb.|hiː ɪz eɪ plɔːzɪbəl kɒkskəʊm.
101456|07-000110|"Ah, well," said misess Almond;| "ɑː, wɛl," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd;
101457|07-000111|if you make up your mind so easily, it's a great advantage.|ɪf juː meɪk ʌp jɔː maɪnd səʊ iːzili, ɪts eɪ ɡɹeɪt ɐdvantɪdʒ.

101459|07-000113|What I tell you is the result of thirty years of observation;|wɒt aɪ tɛl juː ɪz ðə ɹɪzʌlt ɒv θɜːti jiəz ɒv ɒbzəveɪʃən;
101460|07-000114|and in order to be able to form that judgement in a single evening, I have had to spend a lifetime in study.|and ɪn ɔːdə tuː biː eɪbəl tuː fɔːm ðat dʒʌdʒmənt ɪn eɪ sɪŋɡəl iːvnɪŋ, aɪ hav had tuː spɛnd eɪ laɪftaɪm ɪn stʌdi.
101461|07-000115|Very possibly you are right.|vɛɹi pɒsɪbli juː ɑː ɹaɪt.
101462|07-000116|But the thing is for Catherine to see it.|bʌt ðə θɪŋ ɪz fɔː kaθɹɪn tuː siː ɪt.
101463|08-000001|if it were true that she was in love, she was certainly very quiet about it;|ɪf ɪt wɜː tɹuː ðat ʃiː wɒz ɪn lʌv, ʃiː wɒz sɜːtənli vɛɹi kwaɪət ɐbaʊt ɪt;
101464|08-000002|but the Doctor was of course prepared to admit that her quietness might mean volumes.|bʌt ðə dɒktə wɒz ɒv kɔːs pɹɪpeəd tuː ɐdmɪt ðat hɜː kwaɪətnəs maɪt miːn vɒljuːmz.
101465|08-000003|She had told Morris Townsend that she would not mention him to her father, and she saw no reason to retract this vow of discretion.|ʃiː had təʊld mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd ðat ʃiː wʊd nɒt mɛnʃən hɪm tuː hɜː fɑːðə, and ʃiː sɔː nəʊ ɹiːzən tuː ɹɪtɹakt ðɪs vaʊ ɒv dɪskɹɛʃən.
101466|08-000004|It was no more than decently civil, of course, that after having dined in Washington Square, Morris should call there again;|ɪt wɒz nəʊ mɔː ðɐn diːsəntli sɪvəl, ɒv kɔːs, ðat aftə havɪŋ daɪnd ɪn wɒʃɪŋtən skweə, mɒɹɪs ʃʊd kɔːl ðeə ɐɡɛn;
101467|08-000005|and it was no more than natural that, having been kindly received on this occasion, he should continue to present himself.|and ɪt wɒz nəʊ mɔː ðɐn natʃəɹəl ðat, havɪŋ biːn kaɪndli ɹɪsiːvd ɒn ðɪs əkeɪʒən, hiː ʃʊd kəntɪnjuː tuː pɹɛzənt hɪmsɛlf.
101468|08-000006|He had had plenty of leisure on his hands;|hiː had had plɛnti ɒv lɛʒə ɒn hɪz handz;
101469|08-000007|and thirty years ago, in New York, a young man of leisure had reason to be thankful for aids to self-oblivion.|and θɜːti jiəz ɐɡəʊ, ɪn njuː jɔːk, eɪ jʌŋ man ɒv lɛʒə had ɹiːzən tuː biː θaŋkfəl fɔː eɪdz tuː sɛlfəblɪviən.
101471|08-000009|The girl was very happy.|ðə ɡɜːl wɒz vɛɹi hapi.
101472|08-000010|She knew not as yet what would come of it;|ʃiː njuː nɒt az jɛt wɒt wʊd kʌm ɒv ɪt;
101473|08-000011|but the present had suddenly grown rich and solemn.|bʌt ðə pɹɛzənt had sʌdənli ɡɹəʊn ɹɪtʃ and sɒləm.
101474|08-000012|If she had been told she was in love, she would have been a good deal surprised;|ɪf ʃiː had biːn təʊld ʃiː wɒz ɪn lʌv, ʃiː wʊd hav biːn eɪ ɡʊd diːl səpɹaɪzd;
101475|08-000013|for she had an idea that love was an eager and exacting passion, and her own heart was filled in these days with the impulse of self-effacement and sacrifice.|fɔː ʃiː had an aɪdiə ðat lʌv wɒz an iːɡə and ɛɡzaktɪŋ paʃən, and hɜː əʊn hɑːt wɒz fɪld ɪn ðiːz deɪz wɪð ðə ɪmpʌls ɒv sɛlfɪfeɪsmənt and sakɹɪfaɪs.
101476|08-000014|Whenever Morris Townsend had left the house, her imagination projected itself, with all its strength, into the idea of his soon coming back;|wɛnɛvə mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd had lɛft ðə haʊs, hɜː ɪmadʒɪneɪʃən pɹədʒɛktɪd ɪtsɛlf, wɪð ɔːl ɪts stɹɛŋθ, ɪntʊ ðə aɪdiə ɒv hɪz suːn kʌmɪŋ bak;
101477|08-000015|but if she had been told at such a moment that he would not return for a year, or even that he would never return, she would not have complained nor rebelled, but would have humbly accepted the decree, and sought for consolation in thinking over the times she had already seen him, the words he had spoken, the sound of his voice, of his tread, the expression of his face.|bʌt ɪf ʃiː had biːn təʊld at sʌtʃ eɪ məʊmənt ðat hiː wʊd nɒt ɹɪtɜːn fɔː eɪ jiə, ɔː iːvən ðat hiː wʊd nɛvə ɹɪtɜːn, ʃiː wʊd nɒt hav kəmpleɪnd nɔː ɹɪbɛld, bʌt wʊd hav hʌmblɪ ɐksɛptɪd ðə dɪkɹiː, and sɔːt fɔː kɒnsəleɪʃən ɪn θɪŋkɪŋ əʊvə ðə taɪmz ʃiː had ɔːlɹɛdi siːn hɪm, ðə wɜːdz hiː had spəʊkən, ðə saʊnd ɒv hɪz vɔɪs, ɒv hɪz tɹɛd, ðə ɛkspɹɛʃən ɒv hɪz feɪs.
101478|08-000016|Love demands certain things as a right;|lʌv dɪmandz sɜːtən θɪŋz az eɪ ɹaɪt;
101479|08-000017|but Catherine had no sense of her rights;|bʌt kaθɹɪn had nəʊ sɛns ɒv hɜː ɹaɪts;
101480|08-000018|she had only a consciousness of immense and unexpected favours.|ʃiː had əʊnli eɪ kɒnʃəsnəs ɒv ɪmɛns and ʌnɛkspɛktɪd feɪvəz.
101481|08-000019|Her very gratitude for these things had hushed itself;|hɜː vɛɹi ɡɹatɪtjuːd fɔː ðiːz θɪŋz had hʌʃt ɪtsɛlf;
101482|08-000020|for it seemed to her that there would be something of impudence in making a festival of her secret.|fɔː ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː ðat ðeə wʊd biː sʌmθɪŋ ɒv ɪmpjuːdəns ɪn meɪkɪŋ eɪ fɛstɪvəl ɒv hɜː siːkɹɪt.
101483|08-000021|Her father suspected Morris Townsend's visits, and noted her reserve.|hɜː fɑːðə səspɛktɪd mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛndz vɪzɪts, and nəʊtɪd hɜː ɹɪzɜːv.
101484|08-000022|She seemed to beg pardon for it;|ʃiː siːmd tuː bɛɡ pɑːdən fɔː ɪt;
101485|08-000023|she looked at him constantly in silence, as if she meant to say that she said nothing because she was afraid of irritating him.|ʃiː lʊkt at hɪm kɒnstəntli ɪn saɪləns, az ɪf ʃiː mɛnt tuː seɪ ðat ʃiː sɛd nʌθɪŋ bɪkɒz ʃiː wɒz ɐfɹeɪd ɒv ɪɹɪteɪtɪŋ hɪm.
101487|08-000025|His murmurs, however, were inaudible;|hɪz mɜːməz, haʊɛvə, wɜː ɪnɔːdɪbəl;
101488|08-000026|and for a while he said nothing to any one.|and fɔː eɪ waɪl hiː sɛd nʌθɪŋ tuː ɛni wɒn.
101489|08-000027|He would have liked to know exactly how often young Townsend came;|hiː wʊd hav laɪkt tuː nəʊ ɛɡzaktli haʊ ɒfən jʌŋ taʊnsɛnd keɪm;
101490|08-000028|but he had determined to ask no questions of the girl herself -- to say nothing more to her that would show that he watched her.|bʌt hiː had dɪtɜːmɪnd tuː ask nəʊ kwɛstʃənz ɒv ðə ɡɜːl hɜːsɛlf -- tuː seɪ nʌθɪŋ mɔː tuː hɜː ðat wʊd ʃəʊ ðat hiː wɒtʃt hɜː.
101491|08-000029|The Doctor had a great idea of being largely just: he wished to leave his daughter her liberty, and interfere only when the danger should be proved.|ðə dɒktə had eɪ ɡɹeɪt aɪdiə ɒv biːɪŋ lɑːdʒli dʒʌst: hiː wɪʃt tuː liːv hɪz dɔːtə hɜː lɪbəti, and ɪntəfiə əʊnli wɛn ðə deɪndʒə ʃʊd biː pɹuːvd.
101492|08-000030|It was not in his manner to obtain information by indirect methods, and it never even occurred to him to question the servants.|ɪt wɒz nɒt ɪn hɪz manə tuː ɒbteɪn ɪnfəmeɪʃən baɪ ɪndaɪɹɛkt mɛθədz, and ɪt nɛvə iːvən əkɜːd tuː hɪm tuː kwɛstʃən ðə sɜːvənts.

101496|08-000034|misess Penniman's convictions as regards the relations of her niece and the clever young visitor who saved appearances by coming ostensibly for both the ladies -- misess Penniman's convictions had passed into a riper and richer phase.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz kənvɪkʃənz az ɹɪɡɑːdz ðə ɹɪleɪʃənz ɒv hɜː niːs and ðə klɛvə jʌŋ vɪzɪtə huː seɪvd ɐpiəɹənsɪz baɪ kʌmɪŋ ɒstɛnsɪbli fɔː bəʊθ ðə leɪdiz -- mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz kənvɪkʃənz had past ɪntʊ eɪ ɹaɪpə and ɹɪtʃə feɪz.

101502|08-000040|and when at last he questioned her, he was sure she would contrive to extract from his words a pretext for this belief.|and wɛn at last hiː kwɛstʃənd hɜː, hiː wɒz ʃʊə ʃiː wʊd kəntɹaɪv tuː ɛkstɹakt fɹɒm hɪz wɜːdz eɪ pɹiːtɛkst fɔː ðɪs bɪliːf.
101503|08-000041|"Be so good as to let me know what is going on in the house," he said to her, in a tone which, under the circumstances, he himself deemed genial.| "biː səʊ ɡʊd az tuː lɛt miː nəʊ wɒt ɪz ɡəʊɪŋ ɒn ɪn ðə haʊs," hiː sɛd tuː hɜː, ɪn eɪ təʊn wɪtʃ, ʌndə ðə sɜːkəmstansɪz, hiː hɪmsɛlf diːmd dʒiːnɪəl.

101558|08-000096|The Doctor gave a laugh.|ðə dɒktə ɡeɪv eɪ laf.

101574|08-000112|He finds her such an attractive girl?|hiː faɪndz hɜː sʌtʃ an ɐtɹaktɪv ɡɜːl?
101575|08-000113|"Catherine has a lovely nature, Austin," said misess Penniman, "and mister Townsend has had the intelligence to discover that."| "kaθɹɪn haz eɪ lʌvli neɪtʃə, ɔːstɪn," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, "and mɪstə taʊnsɛnd haz had ðə ɪntɛlɪdʒəns tuː dɪskʌvə ðat."

101587|08-000125|I doubt whether I can undertake it.|aɪ daʊt wɛðə aɪ kan ʌndəteɪk ɪt.

101590|08-000128|Her brother puffed his cigar again in silence.|hɜː bɹʌðə pʌft hɪz sɪɡɑː ɐɡɛn ɪn saɪləns.

101620|09-000003|He was absent some twenty minutes, and when he came back into the circle, which was enlivened by the presence of several friends of the family, he saw that Morris Townsend had come in and had lost as little time as possible in seating himself on a small sofa, beside Catherine.|hiː wɒz absənt sʌm twɛnti mɪnɪts, and wɛn hiː keɪm bak ɪntʊ ðə sɜːkəl, wɪtʃ wɒz ɛnlaɪvənd baɪ ðə pɹɛzəns ɒv sɛvɹəl fɹɛndz ɒv ðə famɪli, hiː sɔː ðat mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd had kʌm ɪn and had lɒst az lɪtəl taɪm az pɒsɪbəl ɪn siːtɪŋ hɪmsɛlf ɒn eɪ smɔːl səʊfə, bɪsaɪd kaθɹɪn.
101621|09-000004|In the large room, where several different groups had been formed, and the hum of voices and of laughter was loud, these two young persons might confabulate, as the Doctor phrased it to himself, without attracting attention.|ɪn ðə lɑːdʒ ɹuːm, weə sɛvɹəl dɪfɹənt ɡɹuːps had biːn fɔːmd, and ðə hʌm ɒv vɔɪsɪz and ɒv laftə wɒz laʊd, ðiːz tuː jʌŋ pɜːsənz maɪt kənfabjʊleɪt, az ðə dɒktə fɹeɪzd ɪt tuː hɪmsɛlf, wɪðaʊt ɐtɹaktɪŋ ɐtɛnʃən.
101622|09-000005|He saw in a moment, however, that his daughter was painfully conscious of his own observation.|hiː sɔː ɪn eɪ məʊmənt, haʊɛvə, ðat hɪz dɔːtə wɒz peɪnfəli kɒnʃəs ɒv hɪz əʊn ɒbzəveɪʃən.
101623|09-000006|She sat motionless, with her eyes bent down, staring at her open fan, deeply flushed, shrinking together as if to minimise the indiscretion of which she confessed herself guilty.|ʃiː sat məʊʃənləs, wɪð hɜː aɪz bɛnt daʊn, steəɹɪŋ at hɜː əʊpən fan, diːpli flʌʃt, ʃɹɪŋkɪŋ təɡɛðə az ɪf tuː mɪnɪmaɪz ðə ɪndɪskɹɛʃən ɒv wɪtʃ ʃiː kənfɛst hɜːsɛlf ɡɪlti.
101624|09-000007|The Doctor almost pitied her.|ðə dɒktə ɔːlməʊst pɪtid hɜː.
101625|09-000008|Poor Catherine was not defiant;|pʊə kaθɹɪn wɒz nɒt dɪfaɪənt;
101626|09-000009|she had no genius for bravado;|ʃiː had nəʊ dʒiːnɪəs fɔː bɹavɑːdəʊ;
101627|09-000010|and as she felt that her father viewed her companion's attentions with an unsympathising eye, there was nothing but discomfort for her in the accident of seeming to challenge him.|and az ʃiː fɛlt ðat hɜː fɑːðə vjuːd hɜː kəmpaniənz ɐtɛnʃənz wɪð an ʌnsɪmpəθaɪzɪŋ aɪ, ðeə wɒz nʌθɪŋ bʌt dɪskʌmfət fɔː hɜː ɪn ðə aksɪdənt ɒv siːmɪŋ tuː tʃalɪndʒ hɪm.
101628|09-000011|The Doctor felt, indeed, so sorry for her that he turned away, to spare her the sense of being watched;|ðə dɒktə fɛlt, ɪndiːd, səʊ sɒɹi fɔː hɜː ðat hiː tɜːnd ɐweɪ, tuː speə hɜː ðə sɛns ɒv biːɪŋ wɒtʃt;
101629|09-000012|and he was so intelligent a man that, in his thoughts, he rendered a sort of poetic justice to her situation.|and hiː wɒz səʊ ɪntɛlɪdʒənt eɪ man ðat, ɪn hɪz θɔːts, hiː ɹɛndəd eɪ sɔːt ɒv pəʊɛtɪk dʒʌstɪs tuː hɜː sɪtʃuːeɪʃən.
101630|09-000013|It must be deucedly pleasant for a plain inanimate girl like that to have a beautiful young fellow come and sit down beside her and whisper to her that he is her slave -- if that is what this one whispers.|ɪt mʌst biː djuːsɪdli plɛzənt fɔː eɪ pleɪn ɪnanɪmət ɡɜːl laɪk ðat tuː hav eɪ bjuːtifəl jʌŋ fɛləʊ kʌm and sɪt daʊn bɪsaɪd hɜː and wɪspə tuː hɜː ðat hiː ɪz hɜː sleɪv -- ɪf ðat ɪz wɒt ðɪs wɒn wɪspəz.
101631|09-000014|No wonder she likes it, and that she thinks me a cruel tyrant;|nəʊ wʌndə ʃiː laɪks ɪt, and ðat ʃiː θɪŋks miː eɪ kɹuːəl taɪɹənt;
101632|09-000015|which of course she does, though she is afraid -- she hasn't the animation necessary -- to admit it to herself.|wɪtʃ ɒv kɔːs ʃiː dʌz, ðəʊ ʃiː ɪz ɐfɹeɪd -- ʃiː hasnt ðə anɪmeɪʃən nɛsɪsəɹi -- tuː ɐdmɪt ɪt tuː hɜːsɛlf.
101633|09-000016|"Poor old Catherine!" mused the Doctor;| "pʊə əʊld kaθɹɪn!" mjuːzd ðə dɒktə;
101634|09-000017|I verily believe she is capable of defending me when Townsend abuses me!|aɪ vɛɹili bɪliːv ʃiː ɪz keɪpəbəl ɒv dɪfɛndɪŋ miː wɛn taʊnsɛnd ɐbjuːsɪz miː!
101636|09-000019|He must not condemn Morris Townsend unheard.|hiː mʌst nɒt kəndɛm mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd ʌnhɜːd.
101637|09-000020|He had a great aversion to taking things too hard;|hiː had eɪ ɡɹeɪt ɐvɜːʃən tuː teɪkɪŋ θɪŋz tuː hɑːd;
101638|09-000021|he thought that half the discomfort and many of the disappointments of life come from it;|hiː θɔːt ðat hɑːf ðə dɪskʌmfət and mɛni ɒv ðə dɪsɐpɔɪntmənts ɒv laɪf kʌm fɹɒm ɪt;
101639|09-000022|and for an instant he asked himself whether, possibly, he did not appear ridiculous to this intelligent young man, whose private perception of incongruities he suspected of being keen.|and fɔː an ɪnstənt hiː askt hɪmsɛlf wɛðə, pɒsɪbli, hiː dɪd nɒt ɐpiə ɹɪdɪkjʊləs tuː ðɪs ɪntɛlɪdʒənt jʌŋ man, huːz pɹaɪvət pəsɛpʃən ɒv ɪŋkɒŋɡɹuːɪtiz hiː səspɛktɪd ɒv biːɪŋ kiːn.
101640|09-000023|At the end of a quarter of an hour Catherine had got rid of him, and Townsend was now standing before the fireplace in conversation with misess Almond.|at ðə ɛnd ɒv eɪ kwɔːtə ɒv an aʊə kaθɹɪn had ɡɒt ɹɪd ɒv hɪm, and taʊnsɛnd wɒz naʊ standɪŋ bɪfɔː ðə faɪəpleɪs ɪn kɒnvəseɪʃən wɪð mɪsɛs ɒlmənd.
101641|09-000024|"We will try him again," said the Doctor.| "wiː wɪl tɹaɪ hɪm ɐɡɛn," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
101642|09-000025|And he crossed the room and joined his sister and her companion, making her a sign that she should leave the young man to him.|and hiː kɹɒst ðə ɹuːm and dʒɔɪnd hɪz sɪstə and hɜː kəmpaniən, meɪkɪŋ hɜː eɪ saɪn ðat ʃiː ʃʊd liːv ðə jʌŋ man tuː hɪm.
101643|09-000026|She presently did so, while Morris looked at him, smiling, without a sign of evasiveness in his affable eye.|ʃiː pɹɛzəntli dɪd səʊ, waɪl mɒɹɪs lʊkt at hɪm, smaɪlɪŋ, wɪðaʊt eɪ saɪn ɒv ɪveɪsɪvnəs ɪn hɪz afəbəl aɪ.
101644|09-000027|"He's amazingly conceited!" thought the Doctor;| "hiːz ɐmeɪzɪŋli kənsiːtɪd!" θɔːt ðə dɒktə;
101645|09-000028|and then he said aloud: "I am told you are looking out for a position."|and ðɛn hiː sɛd ɐlaʊd: "aɪ am təʊld juː ɑː lʊkɪŋ aʊt fɔː eɪ pəzɪʃən."
101646|09-000029|"Oh, a position is more than I should presume to call it," Morris Townsend answered.| "əʊ, eɪ pəzɪʃən ɪz mɔː ðɐn aɪ ʃʊd pɹɪzjuːm tuː kɔːl ɪt," mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd ansəd.
101647|09-000030|That sounds so fine.|ðat saʊndz səʊ faɪn.

101649|09-000032|What sort of thing should you prefer?|wɒt sɔːt ɒv θɪŋ ʃʊd juː pɹɪfɜː?
101650|09-000033|Do you mean what am I fit for?|duː juː miːn wɒt am aɪ fɪt fɔː?
101651|09-000034|Very little, I am afraid.|vɛɹi lɪtəl, aɪ am ɐfɹeɪd.
101652|09-000035|I have nothing but my good right arm, as they say in the melodramas.|aɪ hav nʌθɪŋ bʌt maɪ ɡʊd ɹaɪt ɑːm, az ðeɪ seɪ ɪn ðə mɛlədɹɑːməz.
101653|09-000036|"You are too modest," said the Doctor.| "juː ɑː tuː mɒdɪst," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
101654|09-000037|In addition to your good right arm, you have your subtle brain.|ɪn ɐdɪʃən tuː jɔː ɡʊd ɹaɪt ɑːm, juː hav jɔː sʌtəl bɹeɪn.
101655|09-000038|I know nothing of you but what I see;|aɪ nəʊ nʌθɪŋ ɒv juː bʌt wɒt aɪ siː;

101657|09-000040|"Ah," Townsend murmured, "I don't know what to answer when you say that!"| "ɑː," taʊnsɛnd mɜːməd, "aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ wɒt tuː ansə wɛn juː seɪ ðat!"
101658|09-000041|You advise me, then, not to despair?|juː ɐdvaɪz miː, ðɛn, nɒt tuː dɪspeə?
101659|09-000042|And he looked at his interlocutor as if the question might have a double meaning.|and hiː lʊkt at hɪz ɪntələʊkjuːtə az ɪf ðə kwɛstʃən maɪt hav eɪ dʌbəl miːnɪŋ.
101660|09-000043|The Doctor caught the look and weighed it a moment before he replied.|ðə dɒktə kɔːt ðə lʊk and weɪd ɪt eɪ məʊmənt bɪfɔː hiː ɹɪplaɪd.
101661|09-000044|I should be very sorry to admit that a robust and well-disposed young man need ever despair.|aɪ ʃʊd biː vɛɹi sɒɹi tuː ɐdmɪt ðat eɪ ɹəʊbʌst and wɛldɪspəʊzd jʌŋ man niːd ɛvə dɪspeə.

101663|09-000046|Only, I should add, he should choose his line with discretion.|əʊnli, aɪ ʃʊd ad, hiː ʃʊd tʃuːz hɪz laɪn wɪð dɪskɹɛʃən.
101664|09-000047|"Ah, yes, with discretion," Morris Townsend repeated sympathetically.| "ɑː, jɛs, wɪð dɪskɹɛʃən," mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd ɹɪpiːtɪd sɪmpəθɛtɪkli.
101665|09-000048|Well, I have been indiscreet, formerly;|wɛl, aɪ hav biːn ɪndɪskɹiːt, fɔːməli;
101666|09-000049|but I think I have got over it.|bʌt aɪ θɪŋk aɪ hav ɡɒt əʊvə ɪt.
101667|09-000050|I am very steady now.|aɪ am vɛɹi stɛdi naʊ.
101668|09-000051|And he stood a moment, looking down at his remarkably neat shoes.|and hiː stʊd eɪ məʊmənt, lʊkɪŋ daʊn at hɪz ɹɪmɑːkəbli niːt ʃuːz.
101670|09-000053|"Damn his impudence!" the Doctor exclaimed privately.| "dam hɪz ɪmpjuːdəns!" ðə dɒktə ɛkskleɪmd pɹaɪvətli.
101672|09-000055|"I have no particular proposal to make," he presently said;| "aɪ hav nəʊ pətɪkjʊlə pɹəpəʊzəl tuː meɪk," hiː pɹɛzəntli sɛd;

101674|09-000057|Sometimes one hears of opportunities.|sʌmtaɪmz wɒn hiəz ɒv ɒpətjuːnɪtiz.

101676|09-000059|I am afraid I shouldn't be able to manage that.|aɪ am ɐfɹeɪd aɪ ʃʊdnt biː eɪbəl tuː manɪdʒ ðat.
101677|09-000060|I must seek my fortune here or nowhere.|aɪ mʌst siːk maɪ fɔːtʃuːn hiə ɔː nəʊweə.
101679|09-000062|I have a sister, a widow, from whom I have been separated for a long time, and to whom I am almost everything.|aɪ hav eɪ sɪstə, eɪ wɪdəʊ, fɹɒm huːm aɪ hav biːn sɛpəɹeɪtɪd fɔː eɪ lɒŋ taɪm, and tuː huːm aɪ am ɔːlməʊst ɛvɹɪθɪŋ.

101709|09-000092|Ah no, not that;|ɑː nəʊ, nɒt ðat;

101726|09-000109|I can't enter your doors again!|aɪ kant ɛntə jɔː dɔːz ɐɡɛn!
101727|09-000110|"Oh, mister Townsend!" murmured Catherine.| "əʊ, mɪstə taʊnsɛnd!" mɜːməd kaθɹɪn.
101729|09-000112|"I can't in self-respect," said the young man.| "aɪ kant ɪn sɛlfɹɪspɛkt," sɛd ðə jʌŋ man.
101730|09-000113|Your father has insulted me.|jɔː fɑːðə haz ɪnsʌltɪd miː.
101731|09-000114|Insulted you!|ɪnsʌltɪd juː!
101732|09-000115|He has taunted me with my poverty.|hiː haz tɔːntɪd miː wɪð maɪ pɒvəti.
101733|09-000116|Oh, you are mistaken -- you misunderstood him!|əʊ, juː ɑː mɪsteɪkən -- juː mɪsʌndəstʊd hɪm!
101734|09-000117|Catherine spoke with energy, getting up from her chair.|kaθɹɪn spəʊk wɪð ɛnədʒi, ɡɛtɪŋ ʌp fɹɒm hɜː tʃeə.
101735|09-000118|Perhaps I am too proud -- too sensitive.|pəhaps aɪ am tuː pɹaʊd -- tuː sɛnsɪtɪv.
101736|09-000119|"But would you have me otherwise?" he asked tenderly.| "bʌt wʊd juː hav miː ʌðəwaɪz?" hiː askt tɛndəli.
101737|09-000120|Where my father is concerned, you must not be sure.|weə maɪ fɑːðə ɪz kənsɜːnd, juː mʌst nɒt biː ʃʊə.
101738|09-000121|"He is full of goodness," said Catherine.| "hiː ɪz fʊl ɒv ɡʊdnəs," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
101739|09-000122|He laughed at me for having no position!|hiː laft at miː fɔː havɪŋ nəʊ pəzɪʃən!
101740|09-000123|I took it quietly;|aɪ tʊk ɪt kwaɪətli;
101741|09-000124|but only because he belongs to you.|bʌt əʊnli bɪkɒz hiː bɪlɒŋz tuː juː.
101742|09-000125|"I don't know," said Catherine;| "aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ," sɛd kaθɹɪn;
101743|09-000126|I don't know what he thinks.|aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ wɒt hiː θɪŋks.
101744|09-000127|I am sure he means to be kind.|aɪ am ʃʊə hiː miːnz tuː biː kaɪnd.
101745|09-000128|You must not be too proud.|juː mʌst nɒt biː tuː pɹaʊd.
101746|09-000129|"I will be proud only of you," Morris answered.| "aɪ wɪl biː pɹaʊd əʊnli ɒv juː," mɒɹɪs ansəd.
101747|09-000130|Will you meet me in the Square in the afternoon?|wɪl juː miːt miː ɪn ðə skweə ɪn ðə aftənuːn?
101748|09-000131|A great blush on Catherine's part had been the answer to the declaration I have just quoted.|eɪ ɡɹeɪt blʌʃ ɒn kaθɹɪnz pɑːt had biːn ðə ansə tuː ðə dɛkləɹeɪʃən aɪ hav dʒʌst kwəʊtɪd.
101749|09-000132|She turned away, heedless of his question.|ʃiː tɜːnd ɐweɪ, hiːdləs ɒv hɪz kwɛstʃən.
101750|09-000133|"Will you meet me?" he repeated.| "wɪl juː miːt miː?" hiː ɹɪpiːtɪd.
101751|09-000134|It is very quiet there;|ɪt ɪz vɛɹi kwaɪət ðeə;
101752|09-000135|no one need see us -- toward dusk?|nəʊ wɒn niːd siː ʌs -- təwɔːd dʌsk?
101753|09-000136|It is you who are unkind, it is you who laugh, when you say such things as that.|ɪt ɪz juː huː ɑː ʌŋkaɪnd, ɪt ɪz juː huː laf, wɛn juː seɪ sʌtʃ θɪŋz az ðat.
101754|09-000137|"My dear girl!" the young man murmured.| "maɪ diə ɡɜːl!" ðə jʌŋ man mɜːməd.
101755|09-000138|You know how little there is in me to be proud of.|juː nəʊ haʊ lɪtəl ðeə ɪz ɪn miː tuː biː pɹaʊd ɒv.
101756|09-000139|I am ugly and stupid.|aɪ am ʌɡli and stjuːpɪd.
101757|09-000140|Morris greeted this remark with an ardent murmur, in which she recognised nothing articulate but an assurance that she was his own dearest.|mɒɹɪs ɡɹiːtɪd ðɪs ɹɪmɑːk wɪð an ɑːdənt mɜːmə, ɪn wɪtʃ ʃiː ɹɛkəɡnaɪzd nʌθɪŋ ɑːtɪkjʊleɪt bʌt an əʃʊəɹəns ðat ʃiː wɒz hɪz əʊn diəɹɪst.
101758|09-000141|But she went on.|bʌt ʃiː wɛnt ɒn.
101759|09-000142|"I am not even -- I am not even -- " And she paused a moment.| "aɪ am nɒt iːvən -- aɪ am nɒt iːvən -- " and ʃiː pɔːzd eɪ məʊmənt.
101760|09-000143|You are not what?|juː ɑː nɒt wɒt?
101761|09-000144|I am not even brave.|aɪ am nɒt iːvən bɹeɪv.
101763|09-000146|She hesitated a while;|ʃiː hɛzɪteɪtɪd eɪ waɪl;
101764|09-000147|then at last -- "You must come to the house," she said;|ðɛn at last -- "juː mʌst kʌm tuː ðə haʊs," ʃiː sɛd;
101765|09-000148|I am not afraid of that.|aɪ am nɒt ɐfɹeɪd ɒv ðat.
101766|09-000149|"I would rather it were in the Square," the young man urged.| "aɪ wʊd ɹɑːðə ɪt wɜː ɪn ðə skweə," ðə jʌŋ man ɜːdʒd.
101767|09-000150|You know how empty it is, often.|juː nəʊ haʊ ɛmpti ɪt ɪz, ɒfən.
101768|09-000151|No one will see us.|nəʊ wɒn wɪl siː ʌs.

101770|09-000153|But leave me now.|bʌt liːv miː naʊ.
101771|09-000154|He left her resignedly;|hiː lɛft hɜː ɹɪziːnɪdli;
101772|09-000155|he had got what he wanted.|hiː had ɡɒt wɒt hiː wɒntɪd.
101773|09-000156|Fortunately he was ignorant that half an hour later, going home with her father and feeling him near, the poor girl, in spite of her sudden declaration of courage, began to tremble again.|fɔːtʃənətli hiː wɒz ɪɡnəɹənt ðat hɑːf an aʊə leɪtə, ɡəʊɪŋ həʊm wɪð hɜː fɑːðə and fiːlɪŋ hɪm niə, ðə pʊə ɡɜːl, ɪn spaɪt ɒv hɜː sʌdən dɛkləɹeɪʃən ɒv kʌɹɪdʒ, bɪɡan tuː tɹɛmbəl ɐɡɛn.
101774|09-000157|Her father said nothing;|hɜː fɑːðə sɛd nʌθɪŋ;
101775|09-000158|but she had an idea his eyes were fixed upon her in the darkness.|bʌt ʃiː had an aɪdiə hɪz aɪz wɜː fɪkst əpɒn hɜː ɪn ðə dɑːknəs.
101776|09-000159|misess Penniman also was silent;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɔːlsəʊ wɒz saɪlənt;
101777|10-000001|catherine received the young man the next day on the ground she had chosen -- amid the chaste upholstery of a New York drawing-room furnished in the fashion of fifty years ago.|kaθɹɪn ɹɪsiːvd ðə jʌŋ man ðə nɛkst deɪ ɒn ðə ɡɹaʊnd ʃiː had tʃəʊzən -- ɐmɪd ðə tʃeɪst ʌpəʊlstəɹi ɒv eɪ njuː jɔːk dɹawɪŋɡɹuːm fɜːnɪʃt ɪn ðə faʃən ɒv fɪfti jiəz ɐɡəʊ.
101778|10-000002|Morris had swallowed his pride and made the effort necessary to cross the threshold of her too derisive parent -- an act of magnanimity which could not fail to render him doubly interesting.|mɒɹɪs had swɒləʊd hɪz pɹaɪd and meɪd ðə ɛfət nɛsɪsəɹi tuː kɹɒs ðə θɹɛʃəʊld ɒv hɜː tuː dɪɹaɪsɪv peəɹənt -- an akt ɒv maɡnɐnɪmɪti wɪtʃ kʊd nɒt feɪl tuː ɹɛndə hɪm dʌbli ɪntɹɪstɪŋ.
101781|10-000005|It will probably seem to the reader, however, that the Doctor's vigilance was by no means excessive, and that these two young people had an open field.|ɪt wɪl pɹɒbəbli siːm tuː ðə ɹiːdə, haʊɛvə, ðat ðə dɒktəz vɪdʒɪləns wɒz baɪ nəʊ miːnz ɛksɛsɪv, and ðat ðiːz tuː jʌŋ piːpəl had an əʊpən fiːld.
101782|10-000006|Their intimacy was now considerable, and it may appear that for a shrinking and retiring person our heroine had been liberal of her favours.|ðeə ɪntɪməsi wɒz naʊ kənsɪdəɹəbəl, and ɪt meɪ ɐpiə ðat fɔː eɪ ʃɹɪŋkɪŋ and ɹɪtaɪəɹɪŋ pɜːsən aʊə hɛɹəʊɪn had biːn lɪbəɹəl ɒv hɜː feɪvəz.
101783|10-000007|The young man, within a few days, had made her listen to things for which she had not supposed that she was prepared;|ðə jʌŋ man, wɪðɪn eɪ fjuː deɪz, had meɪd hɜː lɪsən tuː θɪŋz fɔː wɪtʃ ʃiː had nɒt səpəʊzd ðat ʃiː wɒz pɹɪpeəd;
101784|10-000008|having a lively foreboding of difficulties, he proceeded to gain as much ground as possible in the present.|havɪŋ eɪ laɪvlɪ fɔːbəʊdɪŋ ɒv dɪfɪkʌltiz, hiː pɹəsiːdɪd tuː ɡeɪn az mʌtʃ ɡɹaʊnd az pɒsɪbəl ɪn ðə pɹɛzənt.
101785|10-000009|He remembered that fortune favours the brave, and even if he had forgotten it, misess Penniman would have remembered it for him.|hiː ɹɪmɛmbəd ðat fɔːtʃuːn feɪvəz ðə bɹeɪv, and iːvən ɪf hiː had fəɡɒtən ɪt, mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wʊd hav ɹɪmɛmbəd ɪt fɔː hɪm.
101786|10-000010|misess Penniman delighted of all things in a drama, and she flattered herself that a drama would now be enacted.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən dɪlaɪtɪd ɒv ɔːl θɪŋz ɪn eɪ dɹɑːmə, and ʃiː flatəd hɜːsɛlf ðat eɪ dɹɑːmə wʊd naʊ biː ɛnaktɪd.
101787|10-000011|Combining as she did the zeal of the prompter with the impatience of the spectator, she had long since done her utmost to pull up the curtain.|kəmbaɪnɪŋ az ʃiː dɪd ðə ziːl ɒv ðə pɹɒmptə wɪð ðə ɪmpeɪʃəns ɒv ðə spɛkteɪtə, ʃiː had lɒŋ sɪns dʌn hɜː ʌtməʊst tuː pʊl ʌp ðə kɜːtən.
101788|10-000012|She too expected to figure in the performance -- to be the confidante, the Chorus, to speak the epilogue.|ʃiː tuː ɛkspɛktɪd tuː fɪɡə ɪn ðə pəfɔːməns -- tuː biː ðə kɒnfɪdɑːnteɪ, ðə kɔːɹəs, tuː spiːk ðə ɛpɪlɒɡ.
101789|10-000013|It may even be said that there were times when she lost sight altogether of the modest heroine of the play, in the contemplation of certain great passages which would naturally occur between the hero and herself.|ɪt meɪ iːvən biː sɛd ðat ðeə wɜː taɪmz wɛn ʃiː lɒst saɪt ɔːltəɡɛðə ɒv ðə mɒdɪst hɛɹəʊɪn ɒv ðə pleɪ, ɪn ðə kɒntəmpleɪʃən ɒv sɜːtən ɡɹeɪt pasɪdʒɪz wɪtʃ wʊd natʃəɹəli əkɜː bɪtwiːn ðə hiəɹəʊ and hɜːsɛlf.
101790|10-000014|What Morris had told Catherine at last was simply that he loved her, or rather adored her.|wɒt mɒɹɪs had təʊld kaθɹɪn at last wɒz sɪmpli ðat hiː lʌvd hɜː, ɔː ɹɑːðə ɐdɔːd hɜː.
101791|10-000015|Virtually, he had made known as much already -- his visits had been a series of eloquent intimations of it.|vɜːtʃuːəli, hiː had meɪd nəʊn az mʌtʃ ɔːlɹɛdi -- hɪz vɪzɪts had biːn eɪ siəɹiz ɒv ɛləkwənt ɪntɪmeɪʃənz ɒv ɪt.
101793|10-000017|This happy certitude had come sooner than Catherine expected, and she had regarded it, very naturally, as a priceless treasure.|ðɪs hapi sɜːtɪtjuːd had kʌm suːnə ðɐn kaθɹɪn ɛkspɛktɪd, and ʃiː had ɹɪɡɑːdɪd ɪt, vɛɹi natʃəɹəli, az eɪ pɹaɪsləs tɹɛʒə.
101794|10-000018|It may even be doubted whether she had ever definitely expected to possess it;|ɪt meɪ iːvən biː daʊtɪd wɛðə ʃiː had ɛvə dɛfɪnətli ɛkspɛktɪd tuː pəzɛs ɪt;
101795|10-000019|she had not been waiting for it, and she had never said to herself that at a given moment it must come.|ʃiː had nɒt biːn weɪtɪŋ fɔː ɪt, and ʃiː had nɛvə sɛd tuː hɜːsɛlf ðat at eɪ ɡɪvən məʊmənt ɪt mʌst kʌm.
101796|10-000020|As I have tried to explain, she was not eager and exacting;|az aɪ hav tɹaɪd tuː ɛkspleɪn, ʃiː wɒz nɒt iːɡə and ɛɡzaktɪŋ;
101797|10-000021|she took what was given her from day to day;|ʃiː tʊk wɒt wɒz ɡɪvən hɜː fɹɒm deɪ tuː deɪ;
101798|10-000022|and if the delightful custom of her lover's visits, which yielded her a happiness in which confidence and timidity were strangely blended, had suddenly come to an end, she would not only not have spoken of herself as one of the forsaken, but she would not have thought of herself as one of the disappointed.|and ɪf ðə dɪlaɪtfəl kʌstəm ɒv hɜː lʌvəz vɪzɪts, wɪtʃ jiːldɪd hɜː eɪ hapɪnəs ɪn wɪtʃ kɒnfɪdəns and tɪmɪdɪti wɜː stɹeɪndʒli blɛndɪd, had sʌdənli kʌm tuː an ɛnd, ʃiː wʊd nɒt əʊnli nɒt hav spəʊkən ɒv hɜːsɛlf az wɒn ɒv ðə fɔːseɪkən, bʌt ʃiː wʊd nɒt hav θɔːt ɒv hɜːsɛlf az wɒn ɒv ðə dɪsɐpɔɪntɪd.
101799|10-000023|After Morris had kissed her, the last time he was with her, as a ripe assurance of his devotion, she begged him to go away, to leave her alone, to let her think.|aftə mɒɹɪs had kɪst hɜː, ðə last taɪm hiː wɒz wɪð hɜː, az eɪ ɹaɪp əʃʊəɹəns ɒv hɪz dɪvəʊʃən, ʃiː bɛɡd hɪm tuː ɡəʊ ɐweɪ, tuː liːv hɜː ɐləʊn, tuː lɛt hɜː θɪŋk.
101800|10-000024|Morris went away, taking another kiss first.|mɒɹɪs wɛnt ɐweɪ, teɪkɪŋ ɐnʌðə kɪs fɜːst.
101801|10-000025|But Catherine's meditations had lacked a certain coherence.|bʌt kaθɹɪnz mɛdɪteɪʃənz had lakt eɪ sɜːtən kəʊhiəɹəns.
101802|10-000026|She felt his kisses on her lips and on her cheeks for a long time afterwards;|ʃiː fɛlt hɪz kɪsɪz ɒn hɜː lɪps and ɒn hɜː tʃiːks fɔː eɪ lɒŋ taɪm aftəwədz;
101803|10-000027|the sensation was rather an obstacle than an aid to reflexion.|ðə sɛnseɪʃən wɒz ɹɑːðə an ɒbstəkəl ðɐn an eɪd tuː ɹiːflɛksiən.
101804|10-000028|She would have liked to see her situation all clearly before her, to make up her mind what she should do if, as she feared, her father should tell her that he disapproved of Morris Townsend.|ʃiː wʊd hav laɪkt tuː siː hɜː sɪtʃuːeɪʃən ɔːl kliəli bɪfɔː hɜː, tuː meɪk ʌp hɜː maɪnd wɒt ʃiː ʃʊd duː ɪf, az ʃiː fiəd, hɜː fɑːðə ʃʊd tɛl hɜː ðat hiː dɪsɐpɹuːvd ɒv mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
101805|10-000029|But all that she could see with any vividness was that it was terribly strange that anyone should disapprove of him;|bʌt ɔːl ðat ʃiː kʊd siː wɪð ɛni vɪvɪdnəs wɒz ðat ɪt wɒz tɛɹɪbli stɹeɪndʒ ðat ɛnɪwɒn ʃʊd dɪsɐpɹuːv ɒv hɪm;
101806|10-000030|that there must in that case be some mistake, some mystery, which in a little while would be set at rest.|ðat ðeə mʌst ɪn ðat keɪs biː sʌm mɪsteɪk, sʌm mɪstəɹi, wɪtʃ ɪn eɪ lɪtəl waɪl wʊd biː sɛt at ɹɛst.
101807|10-000031|She put off deciding and choosing;|ʃiː pʊt ɒf dɪsaɪdɪŋ and tʃuːzɪŋ;
101808|10-000032|before the vision of a conflict with her father she dropped her eyes and sat motionless, holding her breath and waiting.|bɪfɔː ðə vɪʒən ɒv eɪ kɒnflɪkt wɪð hɜː fɑːðə ʃiː dɹɒpt hɜː aɪz and sat məʊʃənləs, həʊldɪŋ hɜː bɹɛθ and weɪtɪŋ.
101809|10-000033|It made her heart beat, it was intensely painful.|ɪt meɪd hɜː hɑːt biːt, ɪt wɒz ɪntɛnsli peɪnfəl.
101810|10-000034|When Morris kissed her and said these things -- that also made her heart beat;|wɛn mɒɹɪs kɪst hɜː and sɛd ðiːz θɪŋz -- ðat ɔːlsəʊ meɪd hɜː hɑːt biːt;
101811|10-000035|but this was worse, and it frightened her.|bʌt ðɪs wɒz wɜːs, and ɪt fɹaɪtənd hɜː.
101812|10-000036|Nevertheless, to-day, when the young man spoke of settling something, taking a line, she felt that it was the truth, and she answered very simply and without hesitating.|nɛvəðəlɛs, tədeɪ, wɛn ðə jʌŋ man spəʊk ɒv sɛtəlɪŋ sʌmθɪŋ, teɪkɪŋ eɪ laɪn, ʃiː fɛlt ðat ɪt wɒz ðə tɹuːθ, and ʃiː ansəd vɛɹi sɪmpli and wɪðaʊt hɛzɪteɪtɪŋ.
101813|10-000037|"We must do our duty," she said;| "wiː mʌst duː aʊə djuːti," ʃiː sɛd;
101814|10-000038|we must speak to my father.|wiː mʌst spiːk tuː maɪ fɑːðə.

101818|10-000042|The young man -- the happy lover -- generally does that.|ðə jʌŋ man -- ðə hapi lʌvə -- dʒɛnəɹəli dʌz ðat.
101820|10-000044|It pleased Catherine to think that she should be brave for his sake, and in her satisfaction she even gave a little smile.|ɪt pliːzd kaθɹɪn tuː θɪŋk ðat ʃiː ʃʊd biː bɹeɪv fɔː hɪz seɪk, and ɪn hɜː satɪsfakʃən ʃiː iːvən ɡeɪv eɪ lɪtəl smaɪl.

101822|10-000046|They are more conciliating;|ðeɪ ɑː mɔː kənsɪlɪeɪtɪŋ;

101826|10-000050|Please don't speak that way -- and promise me this.|pliːz dəʊnt spiːk ðat weɪ -- and pɹɒmɪs miː ðɪs.

101829|10-000053|It won't be much use, but I shall try.|ɪt wɒnt biː mʌtʃ juːs, bʌt aɪ ʃal tɹaɪ.

101833|10-000057|"Ah, we must be prepared," Morris rejoined;| "ɑː, wiː mʌst biː pɹɪpeəd," mɒɹɪs ɹɪdʒɔɪnd;
101834|10-000058|you especially, because for you it must come hardest.|juː ɪspɛʃəli, bɪkɒz fɔː juː ɪt mʌst kʌm hɑːdɪst.
101835|10-000059|Do you know the first thing your father will say to you?|duː juː nəʊ ðə fɜːst θɪŋ jɔː fɑːðə wɪl seɪ tuː juː?
101836|10-000060|No, Morris;|nəʊ, mɒɹɪs;
101837|10-000061|please tell me.|pliːz tɛl miː.
101838|10-000062|He will tell you I am mercenary.|hiː wɪl tɛl juː aɪ am mɜːsənəɹi.
101839|10-000063|Mercenary?|mɜːsənəɹi?
101840|10-000064|It's a big word;|ɪts eɪ bɪɡ wɜːd;
101841|10-000065|but it means a low thing.|bʌt ɪt miːnz eɪ ləʊ θɪŋ.
101842|10-000066|It means that I am after your money.|ɪt miːnz ðat aɪ am aftə jɔː mʌni.
101843|10-000067|"Oh!" murmured Catherine softly.| "əʊ!" mɜːməd kaθɹɪn sɒftli.
101844|10-000068|The exclamation was so deprecating and touching that Morris indulged in another little demonstration of affection.|ðə ɛksklɐmeɪʃən wɒz səʊ dɛpɹɪkeɪtɪŋ and tʌtʃɪŋ ðat mɒɹɪs ɪndʌldʒd ɪn ɐnʌðə lɪtəl dɛmənstɹeɪʃən ɒv ɐfɛkʃən.
101845|10-000069|"But he will be sure to say it," he added.| "bʌt hiː wɪl biː ʃʊə tuː seɪ ɪt," hiː adɪd.
101846|10-000070|"It will be easy to be prepared for that," Catherine said.| "ɪt wɪl biː iːzi tuː biː pɹɪpeəd fɔː ðat," kaθɹɪn sɛd.
101847|10-000071|I shall simply say that he is mistaken -- that other men may be that way, but that you are not.|aɪ ʃal sɪmpli seɪ ðat hiː ɪz mɪsteɪkən -- ðat ʌðə mɛn meɪ biː ðat weɪ, bʌt ðat juː ɑː nɒt.

101849|10-000073|Catherine looked at her lover a minute, and then she said, "I shall persuade him."|kaθɹɪn lʊkt at hɜː lʌvə eɪ mɪnɪt, and ðɛn ʃiː sɛd, "aɪ ʃal pəsweɪd hɪm."
101850|10-000074|"But I am glad we shall be rich," she added.| "bʌt aɪ am ɡlad wiː ʃal biː ɹɪtʃ," ʃiː adɪd.
101851|10-000075|Morris turned away, looking into the crown of his hat.|mɒɹɪs tɜːnd ɐweɪ, lʊkɪŋ ɪntʊ ðə kɹaʊn ɒv hɪz hat.
101852|10-000076|"No, it's a misfortune," he said at last.| "nəʊ, ɪts eɪ mɪsfɔːtʃuːn," hiː sɛd at last.
101853|10-000077|It is from that our difficulty will come.|ɪt ɪz fɹɒm ðat aʊə dɪfɪkʌlti wɪl kʌm.
101854|10-000078|Well, if it is the worst misfortune, we are not so unhappy.|wɛl, ɪf ɪt ɪz ðə wɜːst mɪsfɔːtʃuːn, wiː ɑː nɒt səʊ ʌnhapi.
101855|10-000079|Many people would not think it so bad.|mɛni piːpəl wʊd nɒt θɪŋk ɪt səʊ bad.
101856|10-000080|I will persuade him, and after that we shall be very glad we have money.|aɪ wɪl pəsweɪd hɪm, and aftə ðat wiː ʃal biː vɛɹi ɡlad wiː hav mʌni.
101857|10-000081|Morris Townsend listened to this robust logic in silence.|mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd lɪsənd tuː ðɪs ɹəʊbʌst lɒdʒɪk ɪn saɪləns.
101858|10-000082|I will leave my defence to you;|aɪ wɪl liːv maɪ dɪfɛns tuː juː;

101860|10-000084|Catherine on her side was silent for a while;|kaθɹɪn ɒn hɜː saɪd wɒz saɪlənt fɔː eɪ waɪl;
101861|10-000085|she was looking at him while he looked, with a good deal of fixedness, out of the window.|ʃiː wɒz lʊkɪŋ at hɪm waɪl hiː lʊkt, wɪð eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv fɪkstnəs, aʊt ɒv ðə wɪndəʊ.
101862|10-000086|"Morris," she said abruptly, "are you very sure you love me?"| "mɒɹɪs," ʃiː sɛd ɐbɹʌptli, "ɑː juː vɛɹi ʃʊə juː lʌv miː?"
101863|10-000087|He turned round, and in a moment he was bending over her.|hiː tɜːnd ɹaʊnd, and ɪn eɪ məʊmənt hiː wɒz bɛndɪŋ əʊvə hɜː.
101864|10-000088|My own dearest, can you doubt it?|maɪ əʊn diəɹɪst, kan juː daʊt ɪt?
101865|10-000089|"I have only known it five days," she said;| "aɪ hav əʊnli nəʊn ɪt faɪv deɪz," ʃiː sɛd;
101866|10-000090|but now it seems to me as if I could never do without it.|bʌt naʊ ɪt siːmz tuː miː az ɪf aɪ kʊd nɛvə duː wɪðaʊt ɪt.
101867|10-000091|You will never be called upon to try!|juː wɪl nɛvə biː kɔːld əpɒn tuː tɹaɪ!
101868|10-000092|And he gave a little tender, reassuring laugh.|and hiː ɡeɪv eɪ lɪtəl tɛndə, ɹiːəʃʊəɹɪŋ laf.
101869|10-000093|Then, in a moment, he added, "There is something you must tell me, too."|ðɛn, ɪn eɪ məʊmənt, hiː adɪd, "ðeə ɪz sʌmθɪŋ juː mʌst tɛl miː, tuː."
101870|10-000094|She had closed her eyes after the last word she uttered, and kept them closed;|ʃiː had kləʊzd hɜː aɪz aftə ðə last wɜːd ʃiː ʌtəd, and kɛpt ðɛm kləʊzd;
101871|10-000095|and at this she nodded her head, without opening them.|and at ðɪs ʃiː nɒdɪd hɜː hɛd, wɪðaʊt əʊpənɪŋ ðɛm.
101872|10-000096|"You must tell me," he went on, "that if your father is dead against me, if he absolutely forbids our marriage, you will still be faithful."| "juː mʌst tɛl miː," hiː wɛnt ɒn, "ðat ɪf jɔː fɑːðə ɪz dɛd ɐɡɛnst miː, ɪf hiː absəluːtli fəbɪdz aʊə maɹɪdʒ, juː wɪl stɪl biː feɪθfəl."
101873|10-000097|Catherine opened her eyes, gazing at him, and she could give no better promise than what he read there.|kaθɹɪn əʊpənd hɜː aɪz, ɡeɪzɪŋ at hɪm, and ʃiː kʊd ɡɪv nəʊ bɛtə pɹɒmɪs ðɐn wɒt hiː ɹiːd ðeə.
101874|10-000098|"You will cleave to me?" said Morris.| "juː wɪl kliːv tuː miː?" sɛd mɒɹɪs.
101875|10-000099|You know you are your own mistress -- you are of age.|juː nəʊ juː ɑː jɔː əʊn mɪstɹəs -- juː ɑː ɒv eɪdʒ.

101877|10-000101|Or rather not for all;|ɔː ɹɑːðə nɒt fɔː ɔːl;
101878|10-000102|for she put her hand into his own.|fɔː ʃiː pʊt hɜː hand ɪntʊ hɪz əʊn.
101879|10-000103|He kept it a while, and presently he kissed her again.|hiː kɛpt ɪt eɪ waɪl, and pɹɛzəntli hiː kɪst hɜː ɐɡɛn.
101880|10-000104|This is all that need be recorded of their conversation;|ðɪs ɪz ɔːl ðat niːd biː ɹɪkɔːdɪd ɒv ðeə kɒnvəseɪʃən;
101881|11-000001|catherine listened for her father when he came in that evening, and she heard him go to his study.|kaθɹɪn lɪsənd fɔː hɜː fɑːðə wɛn hiː keɪm ɪn ðat iːvnɪŋ, and ʃiː hɜːd hɪm ɡəʊ tuː hɪz stʌdi.
101882|11-000002|She sat quiet, though her heart was beating fast, for nearly half an hour;|ʃiː sat kwaɪət, ðəʊ hɜː hɑːt wɒz biːtɪŋ fast, fɔː niəli hɑːf an aʊə;
101884|11-000004|On entering it now she found him in his chair beside the fire, entertaining himself with a cigar and the evening paper.|ɒn ɛntəɹɪŋ ɪt naʊ ʃiː faʊnd hɪm ɪn hɪz tʃeə bɪsaɪd ðə faɪə, ɛntəteɪnɪŋ hɪmsɛlf wɪð eɪ sɪɡɑː and ðə iːvnɪŋ peɪpə.

101887|11-000007|"I shall be very happy to hear it, my dear," said her father.| "aɪ ʃal biː vɛɹi hapi tuː hiə ɪt, maɪ diə," sɛd hɜː fɑːðə.
101888|11-000008|He waited -- waited, looking at her, while she stared, in a long silence, at the fire.|hiː weɪtɪd -- weɪtɪd, lʊkɪŋ at hɜː, waɪl ʃiː steəd, ɪn eɪ lɒŋ saɪləns, at ðə faɪə.
101889|11-000009|He was curious and impatient, for he was sure she was going to speak of Morris Townsend;|hiː wɒz kjʊəɹiəs and ɪmpeɪʃənt, fɔː hiː wɒz ʃʊə ʃiː wɒz ɡəʊɪŋ tuː spiːk ɒv mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd;

101892|11-000012|Catherine announced at last, still staring at the fire.|kaθɹɪn ɐnaʊnst at last, stɪl steəɹɪŋ at ðə faɪə.
101893|11-000013|The Doctor was startled;|ðə dɒktə wɒz stɑːtəld;

101898|11-000018|mister Morris Townsend.|mɪstə mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.

101900|11-000020|What she saw was her father's still grey eye and his clear-cut, definite smile.|wɒt ʃiː sɔː wɒz hɜː fɑːðəz stɪl ɡɹeɪ aɪ and hɪz kliəkʌt, dɛfɪnət smaɪl.

101902|11-000022|it was much warmer.|ɪt wɒz mʌtʃ wɔːmə.

101957|11-000077|"No, I have not a bad conscience, father!" the girl cried out, with considerable energy.| "nəʊ, aɪ hav nɒt eɪ bad kɒnʃəns, fɑːðə!" ðə ɡɜːl kɹaɪd aʊt, wɪð kənsɪdəɹəbəl ɛnədʒi.
101958|11-000078|Please don't accuse me of anything so dreadful.|pliːz dəʊnt ɐkjuːz miː ɒv ɛnɪθɪŋ səʊ dɹɛdfəl.
101959|11-000079|These words, in fact, represented to her imagination something very terrible indeed, something base and cruel, which she associated with malefactors and prisoners.|ðiːz wɜːdz, ɪn fakt, ɹɛpɹɪzɛntɪd tuː hɜː ɪmadʒɪneɪʃən sʌmθɪŋ vɛɹi tɛɹɪbəl ɪndiːd, sʌmθɪŋ beɪs and kɹuːəl, wɪtʃ ʃiː ɐsəʊsɪeɪtɪd wɪð malɪfaktəz and pɹɪzənəz.
101960|11-000080|"It was because I was afraid -- afraid -- " she went on.| "ɪt wɒz bɪkɒz aɪ wɒz ɐfɹeɪd -- ɐfɹeɪd -- " ʃiː wɛnt ɒn.
101961|11-000081|If you were afraid, it was because you had been foolish!|ɪf juː wɜː ɐfɹeɪd, ɪt wɒz bɪkɒz juː had biːn fuːlɪʃ!

101965|11-000085|"Dear father, you don't know him," said Catherine, in a voice so timidly argumentative that it might have touched him.| "diə fɑːðə, juː dəʊnt nəʊ hɪm," sɛd kaθɹɪn, ɪn eɪ vɔɪs səʊ tɪmɪdli ɑːɡjuːmɛntətɪv ðat ɪt maɪt hav tʌtʃt hɪm.
101966|11-000086|Very true;|vɛɹi tɹuː;

101970|11-000090|You don't know him either.|juː dəʊnt nəʊ hɪm aɪðə.
101971|11-000091|She stood before the fire, with her hands lightly clasped in front of her;|ʃiː stʊd bɪfɔː ðə faɪə, wɪð hɜː handz laɪtli klaspt ɪn fɹʌnt ɒv hɜː;
101972|11-000092|and her father, leaning back in his chair and looking up at her, made this remark with a placidity that might have been irritating.|and hɜː fɑːðə, liːnɪŋ bak ɪn hɪz tʃeə and lʊkɪŋ ʌp at hɜː, meɪd ðɪs ɹɪmɑːk wɪð eɪ plasɪdɪti ðat maɪt hav biːn ɪɹɪteɪtɪŋ.
101973|11-000093|I doubt, however, whether Catherine was irritated, though she broke into a vehement protest.|aɪ daʊt, haʊɛvə, wɛðə kaθɹɪn wɒz ɪɹɪteɪtɪd, ðəʊ ʃiː bɹəʊk ɪntʊ eɪ viəmənt pɹəʊtɛst.

101978|11-000098|The rest?|ðə ɹɛst?
101979|11-000099|What is the rest?|wɒt ɪz ðə ɹɛst?
101980|11-000100|Whatever it may be.|wɒtɛvə ɪt meɪ biː.
101981|11-000101|There is sure to be plenty of it.|ðeə ɪz ʃʊə tuː biː plɛnti ɒv ɪt.
101982|11-000102|"I know what you mean," said Catherine, remembering how Morris had forewarned her.| "aɪ nəʊ wɒt juː miːn," sɛd kaθɹɪn, ɹɪmɛmbəɹɪŋ haʊ mɒɹɪs had fɔːwɔːnd hɜː.
101983|11-000103|You mean that he is mercenary.|juː miːn ðat hiː ɪz mɜːsənəɹi.
101984|11-000104|Her father looked up at her still, with his cold, quiet reasonable eye.|hɜː fɑːðə lʊkt ʌp at hɜː stɪl, wɪð hɪz kəʊld, kwaɪət ɹiːzənəbəl aɪ.
101985|11-000105|If I meant it, my dear, I should say it!|ɪf aɪ mɛnt ɪt, maɪ diə, aɪ ʃʊd seɪ ɪt!
101986|11-000106|But there is an error I wish particularly to avoid -- that of rendering mister Townsend more interesting to you by saying hard things about him.|bʌt ðeə ɪz an ɛɹə aɪ wɪʃ pətɪkjʊləli tuː ɐvɔɪd -- ðat ɒv ɹɛndəɹɪŋ mɪstə taʊnsɛnd mɔː ɪntɹɪstɪŋ tuː juː baɪ seɪɪŋ hɑːd θɪŋz ɐbaʊt hɪm.
101987|11-000107|"I won't think them hard if they are true," said Catherine.| "aɪ wɒnt θɪŋk ðɛm hɑːd ɪf ðeɪ ɑː tɹuː," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
101988|11-000108|If you don't, you will be a remarkably sensible young woman!|ɪf juː dəʊnt, juː wɪl biː eɪ ɹɪmɑːkəbli sɛnsɪbəl jʌŋ wʊmən!
101990|11-000110|The Doctor smiled a little.|ðə dɒktə smaɪld eɪ lɪtəl.
101992|11-000112|You have a perfect right to ask for them.|juː hav eɪ pɜːfɛkt ɹaɪt tuː ask fɔː ðɛm.
101993|11-000113|And he puffed his cigar a few moments.|and hiː pʌft hɪz sɪɡɑː eɪ fjuː məʊmənts.
101994|11-000114|Very well, then, without accusing mister Townsend of being in love only with your fortune -- and with the fortune that you justly expect -- I will say that there is every reason to suppose that these good things have entered into his calculation more largely than a tender solicitude for your happiness strictly requires.|vɛɹi wɛl, ðɛn, wɪðaʊt ɐkjuːzɪŋ mɪstə taʊnsɛnd ɒv biːɪŋ ɪn lʌv əʊnli wɪð jɔː fɔːtʃuːn -- and wɪð ðə fɔːtʃuːn ðat juː dʒʌstli ɛkspɛkt -- aɪ wɪl seɪ ðat ðeə ɪz ɛvɹɪ ɹiːzən tuː səpəʊz ðat ðiːz ɡʊd θɪŋz hav ɛntəd ɪntʊ hɪz kalkjʊleɪʃən mɔː lɑːdʒli ðɐn eɪ tɛndə səlɪsɪtjuːd fɔː jɔː hapɪnəs stɹɪktli ɹɪkwaɪəz.
101995|11-000115|There is, of course, nothing impossible in an intelligent young man entertaining a disinterested affection for you.|ðeə ɪz, ɒv kɔːs, nʌθɪŋ ɪmpɒsɪbəl ɪn an ɪntɛlɪdʒənt jʌŋ man ɛntəteɪnɪŋ eɪ dɪsɪntɹɪstɪd ɐfɛkʃən fɔː juː.
101996|11-000116|You are an honest, amiable girl, and an intelligent young man might easily find it out.|juː ɑː an ɒnɪst, eɪmiəbəl ɡɜːl, and an ɪntɛlɪdʒənt jʌŋ man maɪt iːzili faɪnd ɪt aʊt.
101997|11-000117|But the principal thing that we know about this young man -- who is, indeed, very intelligent -- leads us to suppose that, however much he may value your personal merits, he values your money more.|bʌt ðə pɹɪnsɪpəl θɪŋ ðat wiː nəʊ ɐbaʊt ðɪs jʌŋ man -- huː ɪz, ɪndiːd, vɛɹi ɪntɛlɪdʒənt -- liːdz ʌs tuː səpəʊz ðat, haʊɛvə mʌtʃ hiː meɪ valjuː jɔː pɜːsənəl mɛɹɪts, hiː valjuːz jɔː mʌni mɔː.
101998|11-000118|The principal thing we know about him is that he has led a life of dissipation, and has spent a fortune of his own in doing so.|ðə pɹɪnsɪpəl θɪŋ wiː nəʊ ɐbaʊt hɪm ɪz ðat hiː haz lɛd eɪ laɪf ɒv dɪsɪpeɪʃən, and haz spɛnt eɪ fɔːtʃuːn ɒv hɪz əʊn ɪn duːɪŋ səʊ.

102001|11-000121|If Morris Townsend has spent his own fortune in amusing himself, there is every reason to believe that he would spend yours.|ɪf mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd haz spɛnt hɪz əʊn fɔːtʃuːn ɪn ɐmjuːzɪŋ hɪmsɛlf, ðeə ɪz ɛvɹɪ ɹiːzən tuː bɪliːv ðat hiː wʊd spɛnd jɔːz.
102002|11-000122|The Doctor delivered himself of these remarks slowly, deliberately, with occasional pauses and prolongations of accent, which made no great allowance for poor Catherine's suspense as to his conclusion.|ðə dɒktə dɪlɪvəd hɪmsɛlf ɒv ðiːz ɹɪmɑːks sləʊli, dɪlɪbəɹətli, wɪð əkeɪʒənəl pɔːzɪz and pɹəlɒŋɡeɪʃənz ɒv aksənt, wɪtʃ meɪd nəʊ ɡɹeɪt ɐlaʊəns fɔː pʊə kaθɹɪnz səspɛns az tuː hɪz kəŋkluːʒən.
102003|11-000123|She sat down at last, with her head bent and her eyes still fixed upon him;|ʃiː sat daʊn at last, wɪð hɜː hɛd bɛnt and hɜː aɪz stɪl fɪkst əpɒn hɪm;
102004|11-000124|and strangely enough -- I hardly know how to tell it -- even while she felt that what he said went so terribly against her, she admired his neatness and nobleness of expression.|and stɹeɪndʒli ɪnʌf -- aɪ hɑːdli nəʊ haʊ tuː tɛl ɪt -- iːvən waɪl ʃiː fɛlt ðat wɒt hiː sɛd wɛnt səʊ tɛɹɪbli ɐɡɛnst hɜː, ʃiː ɐdmaɪəd hɪz niːtnəs and nəʊbəlnəs ɒv ɛkspɹɛʃən.
102006|11-000126|but she too, on her side, must try to be clear.|bʌt ʃiː tuː, ɒn hɜː saɪd, mʌst tɹaɪ tuː biː kliə.
102007|11-000127|He was so quiet;|hiː wɒz səʊ kwaɪət;

102009|11-000129|and she too must be quiet.|and ʃiː tuː mʌst biː kwaɪət.
102010|11-000130|But her very effort to be quiet made her tremble.|bʌt hɜː vɛɹi ɛfət tuː biː kwaɪət meɪd hɜː tɹɛmbəl.
102011|11-000131|"That is not the principal thing we know about him," she said;| "ðat ɪz nɒt ðə pɹɪnsɪpəl θɪŋ wiː nəʊ ɐbaʊt hɪm," ʃiː sɛd;
102012|11-000132|and there was a touch of her tremor in her voice.|and ðeə wɒz eɪ tʌtʃ ɒv hɜː tɹɛmə ɪn hɜː vɔɪs.
102013|11-000133|There are other things -- many other things.|ðeə ɑː ʌðə θɪŋz -- mɛni ʌðə θɪŋz.
102014|11-000134|He has very high abilities -- he wants so much to do something.|hiː haz vɛɹi haɪ ɐbɪlətiz -- hiː wɒnts səʊ mʌtʃ tuː duː sʌmθɪŋ.
102015|11-000135|"He is kind, and generous, and true," said poor Catherine, who had not suspected hitherto the resources of her eloquence.| "hiː ɪz kaɪnd, and dʒɛnəɹəs, and tɹuː," sɛd pʊə kaθɹɪn, huː had nɒt səspɛktɪd hɪðətuː ðə ɹɪzɔːsɪz ɒv hɜː ɛləkwəns.
102016|11-000136|And his fortune -- his fortune that he spent -- was very small!|and hɪz fɔːtʃuːn -- hɪz fɔːtʃuːn ðat hiː spɛnt -- wɒz vɛɹi smɔːl!
102017|11-000137|"All the more reason he shouldn't have spent it," cried the Doctor, getting up, with a laugh.| "ɔːl ðə mɔː ɹiːzən hiː ʃʊdnt hav spɛnt ɪt," kɹaɪd ðə dɒktə, ɡɛtɪŋ ʌp, wɪð eɪ laf.
102018|11-000138|Then as Catherine, who had also risen to her feet again, stood there in her rather angular earnestness, wishing so much and expressing so little, he drew her towards him and kissed her.|ðɛn az kaθɹɪn, huː had ɔːlsəʊ ɹɪzən tuː hɜː fiːt ɐɡɛn, stʊd ðeə ɪn hɜː ɹɑːðə aŋɡjʊlə ɜːnɪstnəs, wɪʃɪŋ səʊ mʌtʃ and ɛkspɹɛsɪŋ səʊ lɪtəl, hiː dɹuː hɜː təwɔːdz hɪm and kɪst hɜː.

102020|11-000140|This question was not reassuring;|ðɪs kwɛstʃən wɒz nɒt ɹiːəʃʊəɹɪŋ;
102021|11-000141|it seemed to Catherine, on the contrary, to suggest possibilities which made her feel sick.|ɪt siːmd tuː kaθɹɪn, ɒn ðə kɒntɹəɹi, tuː sədʒɛst pɒsəbɪlɪtiz wɪtʃ meɪd hɜː fiːl sɪk.
102022|11-000142|But she answered coherently enough -- "No, dear father;"|bʌt ʃiː ansəd kəʊhiəɹəntli ɪnʌf -- "nəʊ, diə fɑːðə;"
102023|11-000143|because if you knew how I feel -- and you must know, you know everything -- you would be so kind, so gentle.|bɪkɒz ɪf juː njuː haʊ aɪ fiːl -- and juː mʌst nəʊ, juː nəʊ ɛvɹɪθɪŋ -- juː wʊd biː səʊ kaɪnd, səʊ dʒɛntəl.
102024|11-000144|"Yes, I think I know how you feel," the Doctor said.| "jɛs, aɪ θɪŋk aɪ nəʊ haʊ juː fiːl," ðə dɒktə sɛd.
102025|11-000145|I will be very kind -- be sure of that.|aɪ wɪl biː vɛɹi kaɪnd -- biː ʃʊə ɒv ðat.
102026|11-000146|And I will see mister Townsend to-morrow.|and aɪ wɪl siː mɪstə taʊnsɛnd təmɒɹəʊ.
102028|12-000002|Morris presented himself with a countenance sufficiently serene -- he appeared to have forgotten the "insult" for which he had solicited Catherine's sympathy two evenings before, and doctor Sloper lost no time in letting him know that he had been prepared for his visit.|mɒɹɪs pɹɪzɛntɪd hɪmsɛlf wɪð eɪ kaʊntənəns səfɪʃəntli səɹiːn -- hiː ɐpiəd tuː hav fəɡɒtən ðə "ɪnsʌlt" fɔː wɪtʃ hiː had səlɪsɪtɪd kaθɹɪnz sɪmpəθi tuː iːvnɪŋz bɪfɔː, and dɒktə sləʊpə lɒst nəʊ taɪm ɪn lɛtɪŋ hɪm nəʊ ðat hiː had biːn pɹɪpeəd fɔː hɪz vɪzɪt.

102032|12-000006|She seems to me quite her own mistress.|ʃiː siːmz tuː miː kwaɪt hɜː əʊn mɪstɹəs.
102033|12-000007|Literally, she is.|lɪtəɹəli, ʃiː ɪz.
102034|12-000008|But she has not emancipated herself morally quite so far, I trust, as to choose a husband without consulting me.|bʌt ʃiː haz nɒt ɪmansɪpeɪtɪd hɜːsɛlf mɒɹəli kwaɪt səʊ fɑː, aɪ tɹʌst, az tuː tʃuːz eɪ hʌsbənd wɪðaʊt kənsʌltɪŋ miː.

102043|12-000017|Morris looked at him an instant.|mɒɹɪs lʊkt at hɪm an ɪnstənt.

102048|12-000022|The Doctor meditated a moment.|ðə dɒktə mɛdɪteɪtɪd eɪ məʊmənt.

102050|12-000024|As Catherine's father, I have, I trust, a just and tender appreciation of her many good qualities;|az kaθɹɪnz fɑːðə, aɪ hav, aɪ tɹʌst, eɪ dʒʌst and tɛndə ɐpɹiːʃɪeɪʃən ɒv hɜː mɛni ɡʊd kwɒlɪtiz;

102062|12-000036|Did you really expect I would say I was delighted, and throw my daughter into your arms?|dɪd juː ɹiəlɪ ɛkspɛkt aɪ wʊd seɪ aɪ wɒz dɪlaɪtɪd, and θɹəʊ maɪ dɔːtə ɪntʊ jɔː ɑːmz?
102063|12-000037|Oh no;|əʊ nəʊ;
102064|12-000038|I had an idea you didn't like me.|aɪ had an aɪdiə juː dɪdnt laɪk miː.
102065|12-000039|What gave you the idea?|wɒt ɡeɪv juː ðə aɪdiə?
102066|12-000040|The fact that I am poor.|ðə fakt ðat aɪ am pʊə.
102067|12-000041|"That has a harsh sound," said the Doctor, "but it is about the truth -- speaking of you strictly as a son-in-law."| "ðat haz eɪ hɑːʃ saʊnd," sɛd ðə dɒktə, "bʌt ɪt ɪz ɐbaʊt ðə tɹuːθ -- spiːkɪŋ ɒv juː stɹɪktli az eɪ sɒnɪnlɔː."
102068|12-000042|Your absence of means, of a profession, of visible resources or prospects, places you in a category from which it would be imprudent for me to select a husband for my daughter, who is a weak young woman with a large fortune.|jɔː absəns ɒv miːnz, ɒv eɪ pɹəfɛʃən, ɒv vɪzɪbəl ɹɪzɔːsɪz ɔː pɹɒspɛkts, pleɪsɪz juː ɪn eɪ katɪɡəɹi fɹɒm wɪtʃ ɪt wʊd biː ɪmpɹuːdənt fɔː miː tuː sɪlɛkt eɪ hʌsbənd fɔː maɪ dɔːtə, huː ɪz eɪ wiːk jʌŋ wʊmən wɪð eɪ lɑːdʒ fɔːtʃuːn.
102069|12-000043|In any other capacity I am perfectly prepared to like you.|ɪn ɛni ʌðə kəpasɪti aɪ am pɜːfɛktlɪ pɹɪpeəd tuː laɪk juː.
102070|12-000044|As a son-in-law, I abominate you!|az eɪ sɒnɪnlɔː, aɪ ɐbɒmɪneɪt juː!
102071|12-000045|Morris Townsend listened respectfully.|mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd lɪsənd ɹɪspɛktfəli.
102072|12-000046|"I don't think Miss Sloper is a weak woman," he presently said.| "aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk mɪs sləʊpə ɪz eɪ wiːk wʊmən," hiː pɹɛzəntli sɛd.
102073|12-000047|Of course you must defend her -- it's the least you can do.|ɒv kɔːs juː mʌst dɪfɛnd hɜː -- ɪts ðə liːst juː kan duː.
102074|12-000048|But I have known my child twenty years, and you have known her six weeks.|bʌt aɪ hav nəʊn maɪ tʃaɪld twɛnti jiəz, and juː hav nəʊn hɜː sɪks wiːks.
102075|12-000049|Even if she were not weak, however, you would still be a penniless man.|iːvən ɪf ʃiː wɜː nɒt wiːk, haʊɛvə, juː wʊd stɪl biː eɪ pɛnɪləs man.
102076|12-000050|Ah, yes;|ɑː, jɛs;
102077|12-000051|that is my weakness!|ðat ɪz maɪ wiːknəs!
102078|12-000052|And therefore, you mean, I am mercenary -- I only want your daughter's money.|and ðeəfɔː, juː miːn, aɪ am mɜːsənəɹi -- aɪ əʊnli wɒnt jɔː dɔːtəz mʌni.
102079|12-000053|I don't say that.|aɪ dəʊnt seɪ ðat.
102080|12-000054|I am not obliged to say it;|aɪ am nɒt əblaɪdʒd tuː seɪ ɪt;
102081|12-000055|and to say it, save under stress of compulsion, would be very bad taste.|and tuː seɪ ɪt, seɪv ʌndə stɹɛs ɒv kəmpʌlʃən, wʊd biː vɛɹi bad teɪst.
102082|12-000056|I say simply that you belong to the wrong category.|aɪ seɪ sɪmpli ðat juː bɪlɒŋ tuː ðə ɹɒŋ katɪɡəɹi.
102083|12-000057|"But your daughter doesn't marry a category," Townsend urged, with his handsome smile.| "bʌt jɔː dɔːtə dʌzənt maɹi eɪ katɪɡəɹi," taʊnsɛnd ɜːdʒd, wɪð hɪz handsʌm smaɪl.
102084|12-000058|She marries an individual -- an individual whom she is so good as to say she loves.|ʃiː maɹiz an ɪndɪvɪdʒuːəl -- an ɪndɪvɪdʒuːəl huːm ʃiː ɪz səʊ ɡʊd az tuː seɪ ʃiː lʌvz.
102085|12-000059|An individual who offers so little in return!|an ɪndɪvɪdʒuːəl huː ɒfəz səʊ lɪtəl ɪn ɹɪtɜːn!
102086|12-000060|"Is it possible to offer more than the most tender affection and a lifelong devotion?" the young man demanded.| "ɪz ɪt pɒsɪbəl tuː ɒfə mɔː ðɐn ðə məʊst tɛndə ɐfɛkʃən and eɪ laɪflɒŋ dɪvəʊʃən?" ðə jʌŋ man dɪmandɪd.
102087|12-000061|It depends how we take it.|ɪt dɪpɛndz haʊ wiː teɪk ɪt.
102088|12-000062|It is possible to offer a few other things besides;|ɪt ɪz pɒsɪbəl tuː ɒfə eɪ fjuː ʌðə θɪŋz bɪsaɪdz;
102089|12-000063|and not only is it possible, but it's usual.|and nɒt əʊnli ɪz ɪt pɒsɪbəl, bʌt ɪts juːʒuːəl.
102090|12-000064|A lifelong devotion is measured after the fact;|eɪ laɪflɒŋ dɪvəʊʃən ɪz mɛʒəd aftə ðə fakt;
102091|12-000065|and meanwhile it is customary in these cases to give a few material securities.|and miːnwaɪl ɪt ɪz kʌstəməɹi ɪn ðiːz keɪsɪz tuː ɡɪv eɪ fjuː mətiəɹiəl sɪkjʊəɹɪtiz.
102092|12-000066|What are yours?|wɒt ɑː jɔːz?
102093|12-000067|A very handsome face and figure, and a very good manner.|eɪ vɛɹi handsʌm feɪs and fɪɡə, and eɪ vɛɹi ɡʊd manə.
102094|12-000068|They are excellent as far as they go, but they don't go far enough.|ðeɪ ɑː ɛksələnt az fɑː az ðeɪ ɡəʊ, bʌt ðeɪ dəʊnt ɡəʊ fɑː ɪnʌf.
102096|12-000070|the word of a gentleman!|ðə wɜːd ɒv eɪ dʒɛntəlmən!
102097|12-000071|The word of a gentleman that you will always love Catherine?|ðə wɜːd ɒv eɪ dʒɛntəlmən ðat juː wɪl ɔːlweɪz lʌv kaθɹɪn?
102098|12-000072|You must be a very fine gentleman to be sure of that.|juː mʌst biː eɪ vɛɹi faɪn dʒɛntəlmən tuː biː ʃʊə ɒv ðat.
102099|12-000073|The word of a gentleman that I am not mercenary;|ðə wɜːd ɒv eɪ dʒɛntəlmən ðat aɪ am nɒt mɜːsənəɹi;
102100|12-000074|that my affection for Miss Sloper is as pure and disinterested a sentiment as was ever lodged in a human breast!|ðat maɪ ɐfɛkʃən fɔː mɪs sləʊpə ɪz az pjʊə and dɪsɪntɹɪstɪd eɪ sɛntɪmənt az wɒz ɛvə lɒdʒd ɪn eɪ hjuːmən bɹɛst!
102101|12-000075|I care no more for her fortune than for the ashes in that grate.|aɪ keə nəʊ mɔː fɔː hɜː fɔːtʃuːn ðɐn fɔː ðə aʃɪz ɪn ðat ɡɹeɪt.
102102|12-000076|"I take note -- I take note," said the Doctor.| "aɪ teɪk nəʊt -- aɪ teɪk nəʊt," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
102103|12-000077|But having done so, I turn to our category again.|bʌt havɪŋ dʌn səʊ, aɪ tɜːn tuː aʊə katɪɡəɹi ɐɡɛn.
102104|12-000078|Even with that solemn vow on your lips, you take your place in it.|iːvən wɪð ðat sɒləm vaʊ ɒn jɔː lɪps, juː teɪk jɔː pleɪs ɪn ɪt.
102105|12-000079|There is nothing against you but an accident, if you will;|ðeə ɪz nʌθɪŋ ɐɡɛnst juː bʌt an aksɪdənt, ɪf juː wɪl;
102106|12-000080|but with my thirty years' medical practice, I have seen that accidents may have far-reaching consequences.|bʌt wɪð maɪ θɜːti jiəz mɛdɪkəl pɹaktɪs, aɪ hav siːn ðat aksɪdənts meɪ hav faɹiːtʃɪŋ kɒnsɪkwənsɪz.
102107|12-000081|Morris smoothed his hat -- it was already remarkably glossy -- and continued to display a self-control which, as the Doctor was obliged to admit, was extremely creditable to him.|mɒɹɪs smuːðd hɪz hat -- ɪt wɒz ɔːlɹɛdi ɹɪmɑːkəbli ɡlɒsi -- and kəntɪnjuːd tuː dɪspleɪ eɪ sɛlfkəntɹəʊl wɪtʃ, az ðə dɒktə wɒz əblaɪdʒd tuː ɐdmɪt, wɒz ɛkstɹiːmli kɹɛdɪtəbəl tuː hɪm.
102108|12-000082|But his disappointment was evidently keen.|bʌt hɪz dɪsɐpɔɪntmənt wɒz ɛvɪdəntli kiːn.
102109|12-000083|Is there nothing I can do to make you believe in me?|ɪz ðeə nʌθɪŋ aɪ kan duː tuː meɪk juː bɪliːv ɪn miː?
102110|12-000084|"If there were I should be sorry to suggest it, for -- don't you see? -- I don't want to believe in you!" said the Doctor, smiling.| "ɪf ðeə wɜː aɪ ʃʊd biː sɒɹi tuː sədʒɛst ɪt, fɔː -- dəʊnt juː siː? -- aɪ dəʊnt wɒnt tuː bɪliːv ɪn juː!" sɛd ðə dɒktə, smaɪlɪŋ.
102111|12-000085|I would go and dig in the fields.|aɪ wʊd ɡəʊ and dɪɡ ɪn ðə fiːldz.
102112|12-000086|That would be foolish.|ðat wʊd biː fuːlɪʃ.
102113|12-000087|I will take the first work that offers, to-morrow.|aɪ wɪl teɪk ðə fɜːst wɜːk ðat ɒfəz, təmɒɹəʊ.

102115|12-000089|I see;|aɪ siː;
102116|12-000090|you think I am an idler!|juː θɪŋk aɪ am an aɪdlə!
102117|12-000091|Morris exclaimed, a little too much in the tone of a man who has made a discovery.|mɒɹɪs ɛkskleɪmd, eɪ lɪtəl tuː mʌtʃ ɪn ðə təʊn ɒv eɪ man huː haz meɪd eɪ dɪskʌvəɹi.
102118|12-000092|But he saw his error immediately, and blushed.|bʌt hiː sɔː hɪz ɛɹə ɪmiːdɪətli, and blʌʃt.
102119|12-000093|It doesn't matter what I think, when once I have told you I don't think of you as a son-in-law.|ɪt dʌzənt matə wɒt aɪ θɪŋk, wɛn wʌns aɪ hav təʊld juː aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk ɒv juː az eɪ sɒnɪnlɔː.
102120|12-000094|But Morris persisted.|bʌt mɒɹɪs pəsɪstɪd.
102121|12-000095|You think I would squander her money.|juː θɪŋk aɪ wʊd skwɒndə hɜː mʌni.
102122|12-000096|The Doctor smiled.|ðə dɒktə smaɪld.
102124|12-000098|but I plead guilty to that.|bʌt aɪ pliːd ɡɪlti tuː ðat.
102125|12-000099|"That's because I spent my own, I suppose," said Morris.| "ðats bɪkɒz aɪ spɛnt maɪ əʊn, aɪ səpəʊz," sɛd mɒɹɪs.
102126|12-000100|I frankly confess that.|aɪ fɹaŋkli kənfɛs ðat.
102127|12-000101|I have been wild.|aɪ hav biːn waɪld.
102128|12-000102|I have been foolish.|aɪ hav biːn fuːlɪʃ.
102129|12-000103|I will tell you every crazy thing I ever did, if you like.|aɪ wɪl tɛl juː ɛvɹɪ kɹeɪzi θɪŋ aɪ ɛvə dɪd, ɪf juː laɪk.
102130|12-000104|There were some great follies among the number -- I have never concealed that.|ðeə wɜː sʌm ɡɹeɪt fɒliz ɐmʌŋ ðə nʌmbə -- aɪ hav nɛvə kənsiːld ðat.
102131|12-000105|But I have sown my wild oats.|bʌt aɪ hav səʊn maɪ waɪld əʊts.
102132|12-000106|Isn't there some proverb about a reformed rake?|ɪsnt ðeə sʌm pɹɒvɜːb ɐbaʊt eɪ ɹɪfɔːmd ɹeɪk?
102133|12-000107|I was not a rake, but I assure you I have reformed.|aɪ wɒz nɒt eɪ ɹeɪk, bʌt aɪ əʃʊə juː aɪ hav ɹɪfɔːmd.
102134|12-000108|It is better to have amused oneself for a while and have done with it.|ɪt ɪz bɛtə tuː hav ɐmjuːzd wɒnsɛlf fɔː eɪ waɪl and hav dʌn wɪð ɪt.
102135|12-000109|Your daughter would never care for a milksop;|jɔː dɔːtə wʊd nɛvə keə fɔː eɪ mɪlksəp;

102137|12-000111|Besides, between my money and hers there is a great difference.|bɪsaɪdz, bɪtwiːn maɪ mʌni and hɜːz ðeə ɪz eɪ ɡɹeɪt dɪfɹəns.
102138|12-000112|I spent my own;|aɪ spɛnt maɪ əʊn;
102139|12-000113|it was because it was my own that I spent it.|ɪt wɒz bɪkɒz ɪt wɒz maɪ əʊn ðat aɪ spɛnt ɪt.
102140|12-000114|And I made no debts;|and aɪ meɪd nəʊ dɛts;

102143|12-000117|"Allow me to inquire what you are living on now -- though I admit," the Doctor added, "that the question, on my part, is inconsistent."| "ɐlaʊ miː tuː ɪŋkwaɪə wɒt juː ɑː lɪvɪŋ ɒn naʊ -- ðəʊ aɪ ɐdmɪt," ðə dɒktə adɪd, "ðat ðə kwɛstʃən, ɒn maɪ pɑːt, ɪz ɪŋkənsɪstənt."
102144|12-000118|"I am living on the remnants of my property," said Morris Townsend.| "aɪ am lɪvɪŋ ɒn ðə ɹɛmnənts ɒv maɪ pɹɒpəti," sɛd mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
102145|12-000119|"Thank you!" the Doctor gravely replied.| "θaŋk juː!" ðə dɒktə ɡɹeɪvli ɹɪplaɪd.
102146|12-000120|Yes, certainly, Morris's self-control was laudable.|jɛs, sɜːtənli, mɒɹɪs sɛlfkəntɹəʊl wɒz lɔːdəbəl.
102148|12-000122|That you should take too much care would be quite as bad as that you should take too little.|ðat juː ʃʊd teɪk tuː mʌtʃ keə wʊd biː kwaɪt az bad az ðat juː ʃʊd teɪk tuː lɪtəl.

102155|12-000129|Do you enjoy the idea of making her miserable?|duː juː ɛndʒɔɪ ðə aɪdiə ɒv meɪkɪŋ hɜː mɪzɹəbəl?
102156|12-000130|I am perfectly resigned to her thinking me a tyrant for a twelvemonth.|aɪ am pɜːfɛktlɪ ɹɪzaɪnd tuː hɜː θɪŋkɪŋ miː eɪ taɪɹənt fɔː eɪ twɛlvɪmʌnθ.
102157|12-000131|"For a twelvemonth!" exclaimed Morris, with a laugh.| "fɔː eɪ twɛlvɪmʌnθ!" ɛkskleɪmd mɒɹɪs, wɪð eɪ laf.
102158|12-000132|For a lifetime, then!|fɔː eɪ laɪftaɪm, ðɛn!

102160|12-000134|Here at last Morris lost his temper.|hiə at last mɒɹɪs lɒst hɪz tɛmpə.

102162|12-000136|You push me to it -- you argue too much.|juː pʊʃ miː tuː ɪt -- juː ɑːɡjuː tuː mʌtʃ.
102163|12-000137|I have a great deal at stake.|aɪ hav eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl at steɪk.
102164|12-000138|"Well, whatever it is," said the Doctor, "you have lost it!"| "wɛl, wɒtɛvə ɪt ɪz," sɛd ðə dɒktə, "juː hav lɒst ɪt!"
102165|12-000139|"Are you sure of that?" asked Morris;| "ɑː juː ʃʊə ɒv ðat?" askt mɒɹɪs;

102169|12-000143|But as I shall strongly recommend it, as I have a great fund of respect and affection in my daughter's mind to draw upon, and as she has the sentiment of duty developed in a very high degree, I think it extremely possible.|bʌt az aɪ ʃal stɹɒŋli ɹɛkəmɛnd ɪt, az aɪ hav eɪ ɡɹeɪt fʌnd ɒv ɹɪspɛkt and ɐfɛkʃən ɪn maɪ dɔːtəz maɪnd tuː dɹɔː əpɒn, and az ʃiː haz ðə sɛntɪmənt ɒv djuːti dɪvɛləpt ɪn eɪ vɛɹi haɪ dɪɡɹiː, aɪ θɪŋk ɪt ɛkstɹiːmli pɒsɪbəl.

102182|12-000156|She is past the age at which people are forbidden, and I am not a father in an old-fashioned novel.|ʃiː ɪz past ðə eɪdʒ at wɪtʃ piːpəl ɑː fəbɪdən, and aɪ am nɒt eɪ fɑːðə ɪn an əʊldfaʃənd nɒvəl.

102184|12-000158|"I don't think she will," said Morris Townsend.| "aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk ʃiː wɪl," sɛd mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
102185|12-000159|Perhaps not.|pəhaps nɒt.

102187|12-000161|"She has gone too far," Morris went on.| "ʃiː haz ɡɒn tuː fɑː," mɒɹɪs wɛnt ɒn.

102189|12-000163|Then let her stop where she is.|ðɛn lɛt hɜː stɒp weə ʃiː ɪz.
102190|12-000164|Too far to stop, I mean.|tuː fɑː tuː stɒp, aɪ miːn.
102191|12-000165|The Doctor looked at him a moment;|ðə dɒktə lʊkt at hɪm eɪ məʊmənt;
102192|12-000166|Morris had his hand on the door.|mɒɹɪs had hɪz hand ɒn ðə dɔː.

102194|12-000168|"I will say no more, sir!" Morris answered;| "aɪ wɪl seɪ nəʊ mɔː, sɜː!" mɒɹɪs ansəd;
102195|13-000001|it may be thought the Doctor was too positive, and misess Almond intimated as much.|ɪt meɪ biː θɔːt ðə dɒktə wɒz tuː pɒzɪtɪv, and mɪsɛs ɒlmənd ɪntɪmeɪtɪd az mʌtʃ.
102196|13-000002|But, as he said, he had his impression;|bʌt, az hiː sɛd, hiː had hɪz ɪmpɹɛʃən;
102197|13-000003|it seemed to him sufficient, and he had no wish to modify it.|ɪt siːmd tuː hɪm səfɪʃənt, and hiː had nəʊ wɪʃ tuː mɒdɪfaɪ ɪt.
102198|13-000004|He had passed his life in estimating people (it was part of the medical trade), and in nineteen cases out of twenty he was right.|hiː had past hɪz laɪf ɪn ɛstɪmeɪtɪŋ piːpəl (ɪt wɒz pɑːt ɒv ðə mɛdɪkəl tɹeɪd), and ɪn naɪntiːn keɪsɪz aʊt ɒv twɛnti hiː wɒz ɹaɪt.
102199|13-000005|"Perhaps mister Townsend is the twentieth case," misess Almond suggested.| "pəhaps mɪstə taʊnsɛnd ɪz ðə twɛntiəθ keɪs," mɪsɛs ɒlmənd sədʒɛstɪd.
102200|13-000006|Perhaps he is, though he doesn't look to me at all like a twentieth case.|pəhaps hiː ɪz, ðəʊ hiː dʌzənt lʊk tuː miː at ɔːl laɪk eɪ twɛntiəθ keɪs.
102201|13-000007|But I will give him the benefit of the doubt, and, to make sure, I will go and talk with misess Montgomery.|bʌt aɪ wɪl ɡɪv hɪm ðə bɛnɪfɪt ɒv ðə daʊt, and, tuː meɪk ʃʊə, aɪ wɪl ɡəʊ and tɔːk wɪð mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi.
102202|13-000008|She will almost certainly tell me I have done right;|ʃiː wɪl ɔːlməʊst sɜːtənli tɛl miː aɪ hav dʌn ɹaɪt;

102206|13-000012|I will write her a frank letter, telling her how matters stand, and asking leave to come and see her.|aɪ wɪl ɹaɪt hɜː eɪ fɹaŋk lɛtə, tɛlɪŋ hɜː haʊ matəz stand, and askɪŋ liːv tuː kʌm and siː hɜː.

102212|13-000018|"Ah," said misess Almond, "when it's a question of thirty thousand a year coming into a family -- "| "ɑː," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd, "wɛn ɪts eɪ kwɛstʃən ɒv θɜːti θaʊzənd eɪ jiə kʌmɪŋ ɪntʊ eɪ famɪli -- "
102213|13-000019|If she stands up for him on account of the money, she will be a humbug.|ɪf ʃiː standz ʌp fɔː hɪm ɒn ɐkaʊnt ɒv ðə mʌni, ʃiː wɪl biː eɪ hʌmbʌɡ.

102216|13-000022|She is not a humbug -- she is an exemplary woman.|ʃiː ɪz nɒt eɪ hʌmbʌɡ -- ʃiː ɪz an ɛɡzɛmpləɹi wʊmən.
102217|13-000023|She will not wish to play her brother a trick simply because he is selfish.|ʃiː wɪl nɒt wɪʃ tuː pleɪ hɜː bɹʌðə eɪ tɹɪk sɪmpli bɪkɒz hiː ɪz sɛlfɪʃ.
102218|13-000024|If she is worth talking to, she will sooner play him a trick than that he should play Catherine one.|ɪf ʃiː ɪz wɜːθ tɔːkɪŋ tuː, ʃiː wɪl suːnə pleɪ hɪm eɪ tɹɪk ðɐn ðat hiː ʃʊd pleɪ kaθɹɪn wɒn.

102225|13-000031|And, meanwhile, how is Catherine taking it?|and, miːnwaɪl, haʊ ɪz kaθɹɪn teɪkɪŋ ɪt?
102226|13-000032|As she takes everything -- as a matter of course.|az ʃiː teɪks ɛvɹɪθɪŋ -- az eɪ matə ɒv kɔːs.

102229|13-000035|She is not scenic.|ʃiː ɪz nɒt siːnɪk.
102230|13-000036|I thought a love-lorn maiden was always scenic.|aɪ θɔːt eɪ lʌvlɔːn meɪdən wɒz ɔːlweɪz siːnɪk.
102231|13-000037|A fantastic widow is more so.|eɪ fantastɪk wɪdəʊ ɪz mɔː səʊ.

102233|13-000039|she thinks me very arbitrary.|ʃiː θɪŋks miː vɛɹi ɑːbɪtɹəɹi.
102234|13-000040|"She has a talent for being in the wrong," said misess Almond.| "ʃiː haz eɪ talənt fɔː biːɪŋ ɪn ðə ɹɒŋ," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd.
102235|13-000041|But I am very sorry for Catherine, all the same.|bʌt aɪ am vɛɹi sɒɹi fɔː kaθɹɪn, ɔːl ðə seɪm.
102236|13-000042|So am I.|səʊ am aɪ.

102239|13-000045|I count upon it.|aɪ kaʊnt əpɒn ɪt.

102242|13-000048|But it only makes me pity her the more.|bʌt ɪt əʊnli meɪks miː pɪti hɜː ðə mɔː.
102244|13-000050|If she can't choose, all the better.|ɪf ʃiː kant tʃuːz, ɔːl ðə bɛtə.
102245|13-000051|Yes, but he will stand there entreating her to choose, and Lavinia will pull on that side.|jɛs, bʌt hiː wɪl stand ðeə ɛntɹiːtɪŋ hɜː tuː tʃuːz, and lavɪniə wɪl pʊl ɒn ðat saɪd.

102247|13-000053|she is capable of ruining an excellent cause.|ʃiː ɪz keɪpəbəl ɒv ɹuːɪnɪŋ an ɛksələnt kɔːz.
102248|13-000054|The day Lavinia gets into your boat it capsizes.|ðə deɪ lavɪniə ɡɛts ɪntʊ jɔː bəʊt ɪt kapsaɪzɪz.
102249|13-000055|"But she had better be careful," said the Doctor.| "bʌt ʃiː had bɛtə biː keəfəl," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
102250|13-000056|I will have no treason in my house!|aɪ wɪl hav nəʊ tɹiːzən ɪn maɪ haʊs!
102251|13-000057|I suspect she will be careful;|aɪ sʌspɛkt ʃiː wɪl biː keəfəl;

102253|13-000059|"They are both afraid of me -- harmless as I am!" the Doctor answered.| "ðeɪ ɑː bəʊθ ɐfɹeɪd ɒv miː -- hɑːmləs az aɪ am!" ðə dɒktə ansəd.
102256|14-000003|It has now disappeared, with its companions, to make room for a row of structures more majestic.|ɪt haz naʊ dɪsɐpiəd, wɪð ɪts kəmpaniənz, tuː meɪk ɹuːm fɔː eɪ ɹəʊ ɒv stɹʌktʃəz mɔː mɐdʒɛstɪk.
102258|14-000005|and before the house was a diminutive yard, ornamented with a bush of mysterious character, and surrounded by a low wooden paling, painted in the same green as the shutters.|and bɪfɔː ðə haʊs wɒz eɪ dɪmɪnjuːtɪv jɑːd, ɔːnəmɛntɪd wɪð eɪ bʊʃ ɒv mɪstiəɹiəs kaɹɪktə, and səɹaʊndɪd baɪ eɪ ləʊ wʊdən peɪlɪŋ, peɪntɪd ɪn ðə seɪm ɡɹiːn az ðə ʃʌtəz.
102259|14-000006|The place looked like a magnified baby-house, and might have been taken down from a shelf in a toy-shop.|ðə pleɪs lʊkt laɪk eɪ maɡnɪfaɪd beɪbihaʊs, and maɪt hav biːn teɪkən daʊn fɹɒm eɪ ʃɛlf ɪn eɪ tɔɪʃɒp.
102260|14-000007|doctor Sloper, when he went to call, said to himself, as he glanced at the objects I have enumerated, that misess Montgomery was evidently a thrifty and self-respecting little person -- the modest proportions of her dwelling seemed to indicate that she was of small stature -- who took a virtuous satisfaction in keeping herself tidy, and had resolved that, since she might not be splendid, she would at least be immaculate.|dɒktə sləʊpə, wɛn hiː wɛnt tuː kɔːl, sɛd tuː hɪmsɛlf, az hiː ɡlanst at ðə ɒbdʒɛkts aɪ hav ɪnjuːməɹeɪtɪd, ðat mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi wɒz ɛvɪdəntli eɪ θɹɪfti and sɛlfɹɪspɛktɪŋ lɪtəl pɜːsən -- ðə mɒdɪst pɹəpɔːʃənz ɒv hɜː dwɛlɪŋ siːmd tuː ɪndɪkeɪt ðat ʃiː wɒz ɒv smɔːl statʃə -- huː tʊk eɪ vɜːtʃuːəs satɪsfakʃən ɪn kiːpɪŋ hɜːsɛlf taɪdi, and had ɹɪzɒlvd ðat, sɪns ʃiː maɪt nɒt biː splɛndɪd, ʃiː wʊd at liːst biː ɪmakjʊlət.
102261|14-000008|She received him in a little parlour, which was precisely the parlour he had expected: a small unspeckled bower, ornamented with a desultory foliage of tissue-paper, and with clusters of glass drops, amid which -- to carry out the analogy -- the temperature of the leafy season was maintained by means of a cast-iron stove, emitting a dry blue flame, and smelling strongly of varnish.|ʃiː ɹɪsiːvd hɪm ɪn eɪ lɪtəl pɑːlə, wɪtʃ wɒz pɹɪsaɪsli ðə pɑːlə hiː had ɛkspɛktɪd: eɪ smɔːl ʌnspɛkəld baʊə, ɔːnəmɛntɪd wɪð eɪ dɛsəltəɹi fəʊlɪɪdʒ ɒv tɪʃuːpeɪpə, and wɪð klʌstəz ɒv ɡlas dɹɒps, ɐmɪd wɪtʃ -- tuː kaɹi aʊt ðə ɐnalədʒi -- ðə tɛmpɹɪtʃə ɒv ðə liːfi siːzən wɒz meɪnteɪnd baɪ miːnz ɒv eɪ kastaɪən stəʊv, ɪmɪtɪŋ eɪ dɹaɪ bluː fleɪm, and smɛlɪŋ stɹɒŋli ɒv vɑːnɪʃ.
102262|14-000009|The walls were embellished with engravings swathed in pink gauze, and the tables ornamented with volumes of extracts from the poets, usually bound in black cloth stamped with florid designs in jaundiced gilt.|ðə wɔːlz wɜː ɛmbɛlɪʃt wɪð ɛŋɡɹeɪvɪŋz sweɪðd ɪn pɪŋk ɡɔːz, and ðə teɪbəlz ɔːnəmɛntɪd wɪð vɒljuːmz ɒv ɛkstɹakts fɹɒm ðə pəʊɪts, juːʒuːəli baʊnd ɪn blak klɒθ stampt wɪð flɒɹɪd dɪzaɪnz ɪn dʒɔːndɪst ɡɪlt.
102263|14-000010|The Doctor had time to take cognisance of these details, for misess Montgomery, whose conduct he pronounced under the circumstances inexcusable, kept him waiting some ten minutes before she appeared.|ðə dɒktə had taɪm tuː teɪk kɒɡnɪsəns ɒv ðiːz diːteɪlz, fɔː mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi, huːz kɒndʌkt hiː pɹənaʊnst ʌndə ðə sɜːkəmstansɪz ɪnɛkskjuːsəbəl, kɛpt hɪm weɪtɪŋ sʌm tɛn mɪnɪts bɪfɔː ʃiː ɐpiəd.
102264|14-000011|At last, however, she rustled in, smoothing down a stiff poplin dress, with a little frightened flush in a gracefully-rounded cheek.|at last, haʊɛvə, ʃiː ɹʌsəld ɪn, smuːðɪŋ daʊn eɪ stɪf pɒplɪn dɹɛs, wɪð eɪ lɪtəl fɹaɪtənd flʌʃ ɪn eɪ ɡɹeɪsfʊlɪɹaʊndɪd tʃiːk.
102265|14-000012|She was a small, plump, fair woman, with a bright, clear eye, and an extraordinary air of neatness and briskness.|ʃiː wɒz eɪ smɔːl, plʌmp, feə wʊmən, wɪð eɪ bɹaɪt, kliə aɪ, and an ɛkstɹɔːdɪnəɹi eə ɒv niːtnəs and bɹɪsknəs.
102266|14-000013|But these qualities were evidently combined with an unaffected humility, and the Doctor gave her his esteem as soon as he had looked at her.|bʌt ðiːz kwɒlɪtiz wɜː ɛvɪdəntli kəmbaɪnd wɪð an ʌnɐfɛktɪd hjuːmɪlɪti, and ðə dɒktə ɡeɪv hɜː hɪz ɛstiːm az suːn az hiː had lʊkt at hɜː.
102267|14-000014|A brave little person, with lively perceptions, and yet a disbelief in her own talent for social, as distinguished from practical, affairs -- this was his rapid mental resume of misess Montgomery, who, as he saw, was flattered by what she regarded as the honour of his visit.|eɪ bɹeɪv lɪtəl pɜːsən, wɪð laɪvlɪ pəsɛpʃənz, and jɛt eɪ dɪsbɪliːf ɪn hɜː əʊn talənt fɔː səʊʃəl, az dɪstɪŋɡwɪʃt fɹɒm pɹaktɪkəl, ɐfeəz -- ðɪs wɒz hɪz ɹapɪd mɛntəl ɹɪzjuːm ɒv mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi, huː, az hiː sɔː, wɒz flatəd baɪ wɒt ʃiː ɹɪɡɑːdɪd az ðə ɒnə ɒv hɪz vɪzɪt.
102268|14-000015|misess Montgomery, in her little red house in the Second Avenue, was a person for whom doctor Sloper was one of the great men, one of the fine gentlemen of New York;|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi, ɪn hɜː lɪtəl ɹɛd haʊs ɪn ðə sɛkənd avənjuː, wɒz eɪ pɜːsən fɔː huːm dɒktə sləʊpə wɒz wɒn ɒv ðə ɡɹeɪt mɛn, wɒn ɒv ðə faɪn dʒɛntəlmən ɒv njuː jɔːk;
102269|14-000016|and while she fixed her agitated eyes upon him, while she clasped her mittened hands together in her glossy poplin lap, she had the appearance of saying to herself that he quite answered her idea of what a distinguished guest would naturally be.|and waɪl ʃiː fɪkst hɜː adʒɪteɪtɪd aɪz əpɒn hɪm, waɪl ʃiː klaspt hɜː mɪtənd handz təɡɛðə ɪn hɜː ɡlɒsi pɒplɪn lap, ʃiː had ðə ɐpiəɹəns ɒv seɪɪŋ tuː hɜːsɛlf ðat hiː kwaɪt ansəd hɜː aɪdiə ɒv wɒt eɪ dɪstɪŋɡwɪʃt ɡɛst wʊd natʃəɹəli biː.

102275|14-000022|"It is not so easy," said the Doctor, smiling.| "ɪt ɪz nɒt səʊ iːzi," sɛd ðə dɒktə, smaɪlɪŋ.
102278|14-000025|I have thought what I should say.|aɪ hav θɔːt wɒt aɪ ʃʊd seɪ.

102284|14-000031|misess Montgomery evidently took the situation very seriously;|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi ɛvɪdəntli tʊk ðə sɪtʃuːeɪʃən vɛɹi siəɹiəsli;
102285|14-000032|she was in a state of extreme moral concentration.|ʃiː wɒz ɪn eɪ steɪt ɒv ɛkstɹiːm mɒɹəl kɒnsəntɹeɪʃən.
102286|14-000033|She kept her pretty eyes, which were illumined by a sort of brilliant modesty, attached to his own countenance, and evidently paid the most earnest attention to each of his words.|ʃiː kɛpt hɜː pɹɪti aɪz, wɪtʃ wɜː ɪluːmɪnd baɪ eɪ sɔːt ɒv bɹɪliənt mɒdəsti, ɐtatʃt tuː hɪz əʊn kaʊntənəns, and ɛvɪdəntli peɪd ðə məʊst ɜːnɪst ɐtɛnʃən tuː iːtʃ ɒv hɪz wɜːdz.
102287|14-000034|Her expression indicated that she thought his idea of coming to see her a very superior conception, but that she was really afraid to have opinions on strange subjects.|hɜː ɛkspɹɛʃən ɪndɪkeɪtɪd ðat ʃiː θɔːt hɪz aɪdiə ɒv kʌmɪŋ tuː siː hɜː eɪ vɛɹi suːpiəɹɪə kənsɛpʃən, bʌt ðat ʃiː wɒz ɹiəlɪ ɐfɹeɪd tuː hav əpɪniənz ɒn stɹeɪndʒ sʌbdʒɛkts.
102289|14-000036|The Doctor took advantage of this admission.|ðə dɒktə tʊk ɐdvantɪdʒ ɒv ðɪs ɐdmɪʃən.
102290|14-000037|I didn't come to see you for your pleasure;|aɪ dɪdnt kʌm tuː siː juː fɔː jɔː plɛʒə;
102291|14-000038|I came to make you say disagreeable things -- and you can't like that.|aɪ keɪm tuː meɪk juː seɪ dɪsɐɡɹiːəbəl θɪŋz -- and juː kant laɪk ðat.
102292|14-000039|What sort of a gentleman is your brother?|wɒt sɔːt ɒv eɪ dʒɛntəlmən ɪz jɔː bɹʌðə?
102293|14-000040|misess Montgomery's illuminated gaze grew vague, and began to wander.|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹiz ɪluːmɪneɪtɪd ɡeɪz ɡɹuː veɪɡ, and bɪɡan tuː wɒndə.
102294|14-000041|She smiled a little, and for some time made no answer, so that the Doctor at last became impatient.|ʃiː smaɪld eɪ lɪtəl, and fɔː sʌm taɪm meɪd nəʊ ansə, səʊ ðat ðə dɒktə at last bɪkeɪm ɪmpeɪʃənt.
102295|14-000042|And her answer, when it came, was not satisfactory.|and hɜː ansə, wɛn ɪt keɪm, wɒz nɒt satɪsfaktəɹi.
102296|14-000043|It is difficult to talk about one's brother.|ɪt ɪz dɪfɪkəlt tuː tɔːk ɐbaʊt wɒnz bɹʌðə.
102297|14-000044|Not when one is fond of him, and when one has plenty of good to say.|nɒt wɛn wɒn ɪz fɒnd ɒv hɪm, and wɛn wɒn haz plɛnti ɒv ɡʊd tuː seɪ.
102298|14-000045|"Yes, even then, when a good deal depends on it," said misess Montgomery.| "jɛs, iːvən ðɛn, wɛn eɪ ɡʊd diːl dɪpɛndz ɒn ɪt," sɛd mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi.
102299|14-000046|Nothing depends on it, for you.|nʌθɪŋ dɪpɛndz ɒn ɪt, fɔː juː.
102301|14-000048|For your brother himself.|fɔː jɔː bɹʌðə hɪmsɛlf.
102302|14-000049|I see!|aɪ siː!
102303|14-000050|"I mean for Miss Sloper," said misess Montgomery.| "aɪ miːn fɔː mɪs sləʊpə," sɛd mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi.
102304|14-000051|The Doctor liked this;|ðə dɒktə laɪkt ðɪs;
102305|14-000052|it had the accent of sincerity.|ɪt had ðə aksənt ɒv sɪnsɛɹɪti.
102306|14-000053|Exactly;|ɛɡzaktli;
102307|14-000054|that's the point.|ðats ðə pɔɪnt.
102308|14-000055|If my poor girl should marry your brother, everything -- as regards her happiness -- would depend on his being a good fellow.|ɪf maɪ pʊə ɡɜːl ʃʊd maɹi jɔː bɹʌðə, ɛvɹɪθɪŋ -- az ɹɪɡɑːdz hɜː hapɪnəs -- wʊd dɪpɛnd ɒn hɪz biːɪŋ eɪ ɡʊd fɛləʊ.
102310|14-000057|He, on the other hand, if he should not be all that we desire, might make her very miserable.|hiː, ɒn ðə ʌðə hand, ɪf hiː ʃʊd nɒt biː ɔːl ðat wiː dɪzaɪə, maɪt meɪk hɜː vɛɹi mɪzɹəbəl.

102312|14-000059|Of course you are not bound to do it.|ɒv kɔːs juː ɑː nɒt baʊnd tuː duː ɪt.
102313|14-000060|My daughter, whom you have never seen, is nothing to you;|maɪ dɔːtə, huːm juː hav nɛvə siːn, ɪz nʌθɪŋ tuː juː;
102314|14-000061|and I, possibly, am only an indiscreet and impertinent old man.|and aɪ, pɒsɪbli, am əʊnli an ɪndɪskɹiːt and ɪmpɜːtɪnənt əʊld man.
102316|14-000063|But I don't think you will do this;|bʌt aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk juː wɪl duː ðɪs;
102317|14-000064|because I think we shall interest you, my poor girl and I.|bɪkɒz aɪ θɪŋk wiː ʃal ɪntɹɪst juː, maɪ pʊə ɡɜːl and aɪ.
102318|14-000065|I am sure that if you were to see Catherine, she would interest you very much.|aɪ am ʃʊə ðat ɪf juː wɜː tuː siː kaθɹɪn, ʃiː wʊd ɪntɹɪst juː vɛɹi mʌtʃ.
102320|14-000067|She is so soft, so simple-minded, she would be such an easy victim!|ʃiː ɪz səʊ sɒft, səʊ sɪmplɪmaɪndɪd, ʃiː wʊd biː sʌtʃ an iːzi vɪktɪm!
102321|14-000068|A bad husband would have remarkable facilities for making her miserable;|eɪ bad hʌsbənd wʊd hav ɹɪmɑːkəbəl fəsɪlɪtiz fɔː meɪkɪŋ hɜː mɪzɹəbəl;
102322|14-000069|for she would have neither the intelligence nor the resolution to get the better of him, and yet she would have an exaggerated power of suffering.|fɔː ʃiː wʊd hav naɪðə ðə ɪntɛlɪdʒəns nɔː ðə ɹɛzəluːʃən tuː ɡɛt ðə bɛtə ɒv hɪm, and jɛt ʃiː wʊd hav an ɛɡzadʒəɹeɪtɪd paʊə ɒv sʌfəɹɪŋ.
102323|14-000070|"I see," added the Doctor, with his most insinuating, his most professional laugh, "you are already interested!"| "aɪ siː," adɪd ðə dɒktə, wɪð hɪz məʊst ɪnsɪnjuːeɪtɪŋ, hɪz məʊst pɹəfɛʃənəl laf, "juː ɑː ɔːlɹɛdi ɪntɹɪstɪd!"
102325|14-000072|Ah!|ɑː!
102326|14-000073|he says that -- he calls it an engagement?|hiː sɛz ðat -- hiː kɔːlz ɪt an ɛŋɡeɪdʒmənt?
102327|14-000074|Oh, he has told me you didn't like it.|əʊ, hiː haz təʊld miː juː dɪdnt laɪk ɪt.
102328|14-000075|Did he tell you that I don't like him?|dɪd hiː tɛl juː ðat aɪ dəʊnt laɪk hɪm?
102329|14-000076|Yes, he told me that too.|jɛs, hiː təʊld miː ðat tuː.
102330|14-000077|"I said I couldn't help it!" added misess Montgomery.| "aɪ sɛd aɪ kʊdnt hɛlp ɪt!" adɪd mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi.
102331|14-000078|Of course you can't.|ɒv kɔːs juː kant.
102332|14-000079|But what you can do is to tell me I am right -- to give me an attestation, as it were.|bʌt wɒt juː kan duː ɪz tuː tɛl miː aɪ am ɹaɪt -- tuː ɡɪv miː an ɐtɪsteɪʃən, az ɪt wɜː.
102333|14-000080|And the Doctor accompanied this remark with another professional smile.|and ðə dɒktə ɐkʌmpənid ðɪs ɹɪmɑːk wɪð ɐnʌðə pɹəfɛʃənəl smaɪl.
102334|14-000081|misess Montgomery, however, smiled not at all;|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi, haʊɛvə, smaɪld nɒt at ɔːl;
102335|14-000082|it was obvious that she could not take the humorous view of his appeal.|ɪt wɒz ɒbviəs ðat ʃiː kʊd nɒt teɪk ðə hjuːməɹəs vjuː ɒv hɪz ɐpiːl.
102336|14-000083|"That is a good deal to ask," she said at last.| "ðat ɪz eɪ ɡʊd diːl tuː ask," ʃiː sɛd at last.
102337|14-000084|There can be no doubt of that;|ðeə kan biː nəʊ daʊt ɒv ðat;

102341|14-000088|misess Montgomery listened in great earnestness to this splendid financial statement;|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi lɪsənd ɪn ɡɹeɪt ɜːnɪstnəs tuː ðɪs splɛndɪd faɪnanʃəl steɪtmənt;
102342|14-000089|she had never heard thousands of dollars so familiarly talked about.|ʃiː had nɛvə hɜːd θaʊzəndz ɒv dɒləz səʊ fəmɪliəli tɔːkt ɐbaʊt.
102343|14-000090|She flushed a little with excitement.|ʃiː flʌʃt eɪ lɪtəl wɪð ɛksaɪtmənt.
102344|14-000091|"Your daughter will be immensely rich," she said softly.| "jɔː dɔːtə wɪl biː ɪmɛnsli ɹɪtʃ," ʃiː sɛd sɒftli.
102345|14-000092|Precisely -- that's the bother of it.|pɹɪsaɪsli -- ðats ðə bɒðə ɒv ɪt.
102347|14-000094|He would be master of all that money?|hiː wʊd biː mastə ɒv ɔːl ðat mʌni?
102348|14-000095|By no means.|baɪ nəʊ miːnz.
102350|14-000097|but I should leave every penny of my own fortune, earned in the laborious exercise of my profession, to public institutions.|bʌt aɪ ʃʊd liːv ɛvɹɪ pɛni ɒv maɪ əʊn fɔːtʃuːn, ɜːnd ɪn ðə lɐbɔːɹiəs ɛksəsaɪz ɒv maɪ pɹəfɛʃən, tuː pʌblɪk ɪnstɪtjuːʃənz.
102351|14-000098|misess Montgomery dropped her eyes at this, and sat for some time gazing at the straw matting which covered her floor.|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi dɹɒpt hɜː aɪz at ðɪs, and sat fɔː sʌm taɪm ɡeɪzɪŋ at ðə stɹɔː matɪŋ wɪtʃ kʌvəd hɜː flɔː.
102353|14-000100|Not at all.|nɒt at ɔːl.
102354|14-000101|That is too much money to get possession of so easily, by marrying.|ðat ɪz tuː mʌtʃ mʌni tuː ɡɛt pəzɛʃən ɒv səʊ iːzili, baɪ maɹiɪŋ.
102355|14-000102|I don't think it would be right.|aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk ɪt wʊd biː ɹaɪt.

102357|14-000104|But in this case your brother wouldn't be able.|bʌt ɪn ðɪs keɪs jɔː bɹʌðə wʊdnt biː eɪbəl.
102358|14-000105|If Catherine marries without my consent, she doesn't get a penny from my own pocket.|ɪf kaθɹɪn maɹiz wɪðaʊt maɪ kənsɛnt, ʃiː dʌzənt ɡɛt eɪ pɛni fɹɒm maɪ əʊn pɒkɪt.
102359|14-000106|"Is that certain?" asked misess Montgomery, looking up.| "ɪz ðat sɜːtən?" askt mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi, lʊkɪŋ ʌp.
102360|14-000107|As certain as that I sit here!|az sɜːtən az ðat aɪ sɪt hiə!
102361|14-000108|Even if she should pine away?|iːvən ɪf ʃiː ʃʊd paɪn ɐweɪ?

102363|14-000110|Does Morris know this?|dʌz mɒɹɪs nəʊ ðɪs?

102365|14-000112|misess Montgomery resumed her meditations, and her visitor, who was prepared to give time to the affair, asked himself whether, in spite of her little conscientious air, she was not playing into her brother's hands.|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi ɹɪzjuːmd hɜː mɛdɪteɪʃənz, and hɜː vɪzɪtə, huː wɒz pɹɪpeəd tuː ɡɪv taɪm tuː ðə ɐfeə, askt hɪmsɛlf wɛðə, ɪn spaɪt ɒv hɜː lɪtəl kɒnsɪɛnʃəs eə, ʃiː wɒz nɒt pleɪɪŋ ɪntʊ hɜː bɹʌðəz handz.

102368|14-000115|unless she be very deep indeed.|ʌnlɛs ʃiː biː vɛɹi diːp ɪndiːd.
102369|14-000116|It is not probable that she is as deep as that.|ɪt ɪz nɒt pɹɒbəbəl ðat ʃiː ɪz az diːp az ðat.
102370|14-000117|"What makes you dislike Morris so much?" she presently asked, emerging from her reflexions.| "wɒt meɪks juː dɪslaɪk mɒɹɪs səʊ mʌtʃ?" ʃiː pɹɛzəntli askt, ɪmɜːdʒɪŋ fɹɒm hɜː ɹiːflɛksiənz.

102373|14-000120|I dislike him, exclusively, as a son-in-law.|aɪ dɪslaɪk hɪm, ɛkskluːsɪvli, az eɪ sɒnɪnlɔː.
102374|14-000121|If the only office of a son-in-law were to dine at the paternal table, I should set a high value upon your brother.|ɪf ðə əʊnli ɒfɪs ɒv eɪ sɒnɪnlɔː wɜː tuː daɪn at ðə pətɜːnəl teɪbəl, aɪ ʃʊd sɛt eɪ haɪ valjuː əpɒn jɔː bɹʌðə.
102375|14-000122|He dines capitally.|hiː daɪnz kapɪtəli.
102376|14-000123|But that is a small part of his function, which, in general, is to be a protector and caretaker of my child, who is singularly ill-adapted to take care of herself.|bʌt ðat ɪz eɪ smɔːl pɑːt ɒv hɪz fʌŋkʃən, wɪtʃ, ɪn dʒɛnəɹəl, ɪz tuː biː eɪ pɹətɛktə and keəteɪkə ɒv maɪ tʃaɪld, huː ɪz sɪŋɡjʊləli ɪladaptɪd tuː teɪk keə ɒv hɜːsɛlf.

102384|14-000131|Do you think he hides it so well?|duː juː θɪŋk hiː haɪdz ɪt səʊ wɛl?
102385|14-000132|"Very well indeed," said misess Montgomery.| "vɛɹi wɛl ɪndiːd," sɛd mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi.
102386|14-000133|"And I think we are all rather selfish," she added quickly.| "and aɪ θɪŋk wiː ɑː ɔːl ɹɑːðə sɛlfɪʃ," ʃiː adɪd kwɪkli.
102387|14-000134|I think so too;|aɪ θɪŋk səʊ tuː;

102392|14-000139|The Doctor eyed her a moment.|ðə dɒktə aɪd hɜː eɪ məʊmənt.
102393|14-000140|You women are all the same!|juː wɪmɪn ɑː ɔːl ðə seɪm!
102394|14-000141|But the type to which your brother belongs was made to be the ruin of you, and you were made to be its handmaids and victims.|bʌt ðə taɪp tuː wɪtʃ jɔː bɹʌðə bɪlɒŋz wɒz meɪd tuː biː ðə ɹuːɪn ɒv juː, and juː wɜː meɪd tuː biː ɪts handmeɪdz and vɪktɪmz.
102395|14-000142|The sign of the type in question is the determination -- sometimes terrible in its quiet intensity -- to accept nothing of life but its pleasures, and to secure these pleasures chiefly by the aid of your complaisant sex.|ðə saɪn ɒv ðə taɪp ɪn kwɛstʃən ɪz ðə dɪtɜːmɪneɪʃən -- sʌmtaɪmz tɛɹɪbəl ɪn ɪts kwaɪət ɪntɛnsɪti -- tuː ɐksɛpt nʌθɪŋ ɒv laɪf bʌt ɪts plɛʒəz, and tuː sɪkjʊə ðiːz plɛʒəz tʃiːfli baɪ ðə eɪd ɒv jɔː kəmpleɪsənt sɛks.
102396|14-000143|Young men of this class never do anything for themselves that they can get other people to do for them, and it is the infatuation, the devotion, the superstition of others that keeps them going.|jʌŋ mɛn ɒv ðɪs klas nɛvə duː ɛnɪθɪŋ fɔː ðɛmsɛlvz ðat ðeɪ kan ɡɛt ʌðə piːpəl tuː duː fɔː ðɛm, and ɪt ɪz ðə ɪnfatʃuːeɪʃən, ðə dɪvəʊʃən, ðə suːpəstɪʃən ɒv ʌðəz ðat kiːps ðɛm ɡəʊɪŋ.

102400|14-000147|The Doctor paused a moment, and then he added abruptly, "You have suffered immensely for your brother!"|ðə dɒktə pɔːzd eɪ məʊmənt, and ðɛn hiː adɪd ɐbɹʌptli, "juː hav sʌfəd ɪmɛnsli fɔː jɔː bɹʌðə!"
102401|14-000148|This exclamation was abrupt, as I say, but it was also perfectly calculated.|ðɪs ɛksklɐmeɪʃən wɒz ɐbɹʌpt, az aɪ seɪ, bʌt ɪt wɒz ɔːlsəʊ pɜːfɛktlɪ kalkjʊleɪtɪd.
102402|14-000149|The Doctor had been rather disappointed at not finding his compact and comfortable little hostess surrounded in a more visible degree by the ravages of Morris Townsend's immorality;|ðə dɒktə had biːn ɹɑːðə dɪsɐpɔɪntɪd at nɒt faɪndɪŋ hɪz kəmpakt and kʌmftəbəl lɪtəl həʊstɛs səɹaʊndɪd ɪn eɪ mɔː vɪzɪbəl dɪɡɹiː baɪ ðə ɹavɪdʒɪz ɒv mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛndz ɪməɹalɪti;
102403|14-000150|but he had said to himself that this was not because the young man had spared her, but because she had contrived to plaster up her wounds.|bʌt hiː had sɛd tuː hɪmsɛlf ðat ðɪs wɒz nɒt bɪkɒz ðə jʌŋ man had speəd hɜː, bʌt bɪkɒz ʃiː had kəntɹaɪvd tuː plastə ʌp hɜː wuːndz.

102408|14-000155|The tears sprang for a moment to misess Montgomery's eyes, and she indulged in a proud little jerk of the head.|ðə tiəz spɹaŋ fɔː eɪ məʊmənt tuː mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹiz aɪz, and ʃiː ɪndʌldʒd ɪn eɪ pɹaʊd lɪtəl dʒɜːk ɒv ðə hɛd.

102414|14-000161|I think you ought to answer that.|aɪ θɪŋk juː ɔːt tuː ansə ðat.
102415|14-000162|"Yes, I have given him money," said misess Montgomery.| "jɛs, aɪ hav ɡɪvən hɪm mʌni," sɛd mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi.
102416|14-000163|And you have not had much to give him?|and juː hav nɒt had mʌtʃ tuː ɡɪv hɪm?
102417|14-000164|She was silent a moment.|ʃiː wɒz saɪlənt eɪ məʊmənt.

102419|14-000166|I am very poor.|aɪ am vɛɹi pʊə.
102420|14-000167|"One would never suppose it from your -- your charming house," said the Doctor.| "wɒn wʊd nɛvə səpəʊz ɪt fɹɒm jɔː -- jɔː tʃɑːmɪŋ haʊs," sɛd ðə dɒktə.

102426|14-000173|Counted them over?|kaʊntɪd ðɛm əʊvə?
102427|14-000174|He knows there are five, I mean.|hiː nəʊz ðeə ɑː faɪv, aɪ miːn.
102428|14-000175|He tells me it is he that brings them up.|hiː tɛlz miː ɪt ɪz hiː ðat bɹɪŋz ðɛm ʌp.
102429|14-000176|misess Montgomery stared a moment, and then quickly -- "Oh yes;"|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi steəd eɪ məʊmənt, and ðɛn kwɪkli -- "əʊ jɛs;"
102430|14-000177|he teaches them Spanish.|hiː tiːtʃɪz ðɛm spanɪʃ.
102431|14-000178|The Doctor laughed out.|ðə dɒktə laft aʊt.
102432|14-000179|That must take a great deal off your hands!|ðat mʌst teɪk eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl ɒf jɔː handz!
102433|14-000180|Your brother also knows, of course, that you have very little money.|jɔː bɹʌðə ɔːlsəʊ nəʊz, ɒv kɔːs, ðat juː hav vɛɹi lɪtəl mʌni.
102434|14-000181|"I have often told him so!" misess Montgomery exclaimed, more unreservedly than she had yet spoken.| "aɪ hav ɒfən təʊld hɪm səʊ!" mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi ɛkskleɪmd, mɔː ʌnɹɪzɜːvɪdli ðɐn ʃiː had jɛt spəʊkən.
102435|14-000182|She was apparently taking some comfort in the Doctor's clairvoyancy.|ʃiː wɒz ɐpaɹəntli teɪkɪŋ sʌm kʌmfət ɪn ðə dɒktəz kleəvɔɪənsi.
102436|14-000183|Which means that you have often occasion to, and that he often sponges on you.|wɪtʃ miːnz ðat juː hav ɒfən əkeɪʒən tuː, and ðat hiː ɒfən spʌndʒɪz ɒn juː.
102437|14-000184|Excuse the crudity of my language;|ɛkskjuːs ðə kɹuːdɪti ɒv maɪ laŋɡwɪdʒ;

102440|14-000187|I have ascertained what I suspected -- what I wished.|aɪ hav asəteɪnd wɒt aɪ səspɛktɪd -- wɒt aɪ wɪʃt.
102441|14-000188|And the Doctor got up, gently smoothing his hat.|and ðə dɒktə ɡɒt ʌp, dʒɛntli smuːðɪŋ hɪz hat.
102442|14-000189|"Your brother lives on you," he said as he stood there.| "jɔː bɹʌðə laɪvz ɒn juː," hiː sɛd az hiː stʊd ðeə.
102444|14-000191|But then, with a certain inconsequence -- "I have never complained of him!" she said.|bʌt ðɛn, wɪð eɪ sɜːtən ɪŋkɒnsɪkwəns -- "aɪ hav nɛvə kəmpleɪnd ɒv hɪm!" ʃiː sɛd.

102446|14-000193|But I advise you not to give him any more money.|bʌt aɪ ɐdvaɪz juː nɒt tuː ɡɪv hɪm ɛni mɔː mʌni.
102447|14-000194|"Don't you see it is in my interest that he should marry a rich person?" she asked.| "dəʊnt juː siː ɪt ɪz ɪn maɪ ɪntɹɪst ðat hiː ʃʊd maɹi eɪ ɹɪtʃ pɜːsən?" ʃiː askt.
102449|14-000196|"I wish very much you would come to me with your difficulties," said the Doctor.| "aɪ wɪʃ vɛɹi mʌtʃ juː wʊd kʌm tuː miː wɪð jɔː dɪfɪkʌltiz," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
102450|14-000197|Certainly, if I throw him back on your hands, the least I can do is to help you to bear the burden.|sɜːtənli, ɪf aɪ θɹəʊ hɪm bak ɒn jɔː handz, ðə liːst aɪ kan duː ɪz tuː hɛlp juː tuː beə ðə bɜːdən.
102452|14-000199|misess Montgomery stared;|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi steəd;
102453|14-000200|she evidently thought he was jesting;|ʃiː ɛvɪdəntli θɔːt hiː wɒz dʒɛstɪŋ;
102454|14-000201|but she presently saw that he was not, and the complication of her feelings became painful.|bʌt ʃiː pɹɛzəntli sɔː ðat hiː wɒz nɒt, and ðə kɒmplɪkeɪʃən ɒv hɜː fiːlɪŋz bɪkeɪm peɪnfəl.

102456|14-000203|Because I have offered you money?|bɪkɒz aɪ hav ɒfəd juː mʌni?
102457|14-000204|"That's a superstition," said the Doctor.| "ðats eɪ suːpəstɪʃən," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
102458|14-000205|You must let me come and see you again, and we will talk about these things.|juː mʌst lɛt miː kʌm and siː juː ɐɡɛn, and wiː wɪl tɔːk ɐbaʊt ðiːz θɪŋz.

102460|14-000207|"I have two little girls," said misess Montgomery.| "aɪ hav tuː lɪtəl ɡɜːlz," sɛd mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi.
102461|14-000208|Well, when they grow up, and begin to think of taking husbands, you will see how anxious you will be about the moral character of these gentlemen.|wɛl, wɛn ðeɪ ɡɹəʊ ʌp, and bɪɡɪn tuː θɪŋk ɒv teɪkɪŋ hʌsbəndz, juː wɪl siː haʊ aŋʃəs juː wɪl biː ɐbaʊt ðə mɒɹəl kaɹɪktə ɒv ðiːz dʒɛntəlmən.

102464|14-000211|The Doctor looked at her a little, with folded arms.|ðə dɒktə lʊkt at hɜː eɪ lɪtəl, wɪð fəʊldɪd ɑːmz.
102465|14-000212|There is something I should greatly like -- as a moral satisfaction.|ðeə ɪz sʌmθɪŋ aɪ ʃʊd ɡɹeɪtli laɪk -- az eɪ mɒɹəl satɪsfakʃən.

102468|14-000215|She gazed at it an instant, and then she turned away.|ʃiː ɡeɪzd at ɪt an ɪnstənt, and ðɛn ʃiː tɜːnd ɐweɪ.

102475|14-000222|You must know her, and you will see.|juː mʌst nəʊ hɜː, and juː wɪl siː.
102476|14-000223|misess Montgomery brushed away her tears, and blushed at having shed them.|mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi bɹʌʃt ɐweɪ hɜː tiəz, and blʌʃt at havɪŋ ʃɛd ðɛm.
102477|14-000224|"I should like to know your daughter," she answered;| "aɪ ʃʊd laɪk tuː nəʊ jɔː dɔːtə," ʃiː ansəd;
102478|14-000225|and then, in an instant -- "Don't let her marry him!"|and ðɛn, ɪn an ɪnstənt -- "dəʊnt lɛt hɜː maɹi hɪm!"
102479|14-000226|doctor Sloper went away with the words gently humming in his ears -- "Don't let her marry him!"|dɒktə sləʊpə wɛnt ɐweɪ wɪð ðə wɜːdz dʒɛntli hʌmɪŋ ɪn hɪz iəz -- "dəʊnt lɛt hɜː maɹi hɪm!"
102480|15-000001|he had been puzzled by the way that Catherine carried herself;|hiː had biːn pʌzəld baɪ ðə weɪ ðat kaθɹɪn kaɹid hɜːsɛlf;
102481|15-000002|her attitude at this sentimental crisis seemed to him unnaturally passive.|hɜː atɪtjuːd at ðɪs sɛntɪmɛntəl kɹaɪsɪs siːmd tuː hɪm ʌnnatʃəɹəli pasɪv.
102482|15-000003|She had not spoken to him again after that scene in the library, the day before his interview with Morris;|ʃiː had nɒt spəʊkən tuː hɪm ɐɡɛn aftə ðat siːn ɪn ðə laɪbɹəɹi, ðə deɪ bɪfɔː hɪz ɪntəvjuː wɪð mɒɹɪs;

102484|15-000005|There was nothing in it that appealed for pity, and he was even a little disappointed at her not giving him an opportunity to make up for his harshness by some manifestation of liberality which should operate as a compensation.|ðeə wɒz nʌθɪŋ ɪn ɪt ðat ɐpiːld fɔː pɪti, and hiː wɒz iːvən eɪ lɪtəl dɪsɐpɔɪntɪd at hɜː nɒt ɡɪvɪŋ hɪm an ɒpətjuːnɪti tuː meɪk ʌp fɔː hɪz hɑːʃnəs baɪ sʌm manɪfɪsteɪʃən ɒv lɪbəɹalɪti wɪtʃ ʃʊd ɒpəɹeɪt az eɪ kɒmpənseɪʃən.

102486|15-000007|but he was determined to do this only in case she should seem mutely to reproach him.|bʌt hiː wɒz dɪtɜːmɪnd tuː duː ðɪs əʊnli ɪn keɪs ʃiː ʃʊd siːm mjuːtli tuː ɹɪpɹəʊtʃ hɪm.
102487|15-000008|He had an idea that she would display a talent for mute reproaches, and he was surprised at not finding himself exposed to these silent batteries.|hiː had an aɪdiə ðat ʃiː wʊd dɪspleɪ eɪ talənt fɔː mjuːt ɹɪpɹəʊtʃɪz, and hiː wɒz səpɹaɪzd at nɒt faɪndɪŋ hɪmsɛlf ɛkspəʊzd tuː ðiːz saɪlənt batəɹiz.
102489|15-000010|And poor Catherine was not sulky -- a style of behaviour for which she had too little histrionic talent;|and pʊə kaθɹɪn wɒz nɒt sʌlki -- eɪ staɪl ɒv bɪheɪvjə fɔː wɪtʃ ʃiː had tuː lɪtəl hɪstɹɪɒnɪk talənt;
102491|15-000012|Of course she was thinking over her situation, and she was apparently doing so in a deliberate and unimpassioned manner, with a view of making the best of it.|ɒv kɔːs ʃiː wɒz θɪŋkɪŋ əʊvə hɜː sɪtʃuːeɪʃən, and ʃiː wɒz ɐpaɹəntli duːɪŋ səʊ ɪn eɪ dɪlɪbəɹət and ʌnɪmpaʃənd manə, wɪð eɪ vjuː ɒv meɪkɪŋ ðə bɛst ɒv ɪt.
102493|15-000014|I know not whether he had hoped for a little more resistance for the sake of a little more entertainment;|aɪ nəʊ nɒt wɛðə hiː had həʊpt fɔː eɪ lɪtəl mɔː ɹɪsɪstəns fɔː ðə seɪk ɒv eɪ lɪtəl mɔː ɛntəteɪnmənt;
102495|15-000016|Catherine, meanwhile, had made a discovery of a very different sort;|kaθɹɪn, miːnwaɪl, had meɪd eɪ dɪskʌvəɹi ɒv eɪ vɛɹi dɪfɹənt sɔːt;

102499|15-000020|It was as if this other person, who was both herself and not herself, had suddenly sprung into being, inspiring her with a natural curiosity as to the performance of untested functions.|ɪt wɒz az ɪf ðɪs ʌðə pɜːsən, huː wɒz bəʊθ hɜːsɛlf and nɒt hɜːsɛlf, had sʌdənli spɹʌŋ ɪntʊ biːɪŋ, ɪnspaɪəɹɪŋ hɜː wɪð eɪ natʃəɹəl kjʊəɹɪɒsɪti az tuː ðə pəfɔːməns ɒv ʌntɛstɪd fʌŋkʃənz.

102511|15-000032|it consisted of five pages, in a remarkably neat and handsome hand.|ɪt kənsɪstɪd ɒv faɪv peɪdʒɪz, ɪn eɪ ɹɪmɑːkəbli niːt and handsʌm hand.
102512|15-000033|Catherine's handwriting was beautiful, and she was even a little proud of it;|kaθɹɪnz handɹaɪtɪŋ wɒz bjuːtifəl, and ʃiː wɒz iːvən eɪ lɪtəl pɹaʊd ɒv ɪt;
102513|15-000034|she was extremely fond of copying, and possessed volumes of extracts which testified to this accomplishment;|ʃiː wɒz ɛkstɹiːmli fɒnd ɒv kɒpɪɪŋ, and pəzɛst vɒljuːmz ɒv ɛkstɹakts wɪtʃ tɛstɪfaɪd tuː ðɪs ɐkɒmplɪʃmənt;
102514|15-000035|volumes which she had exhibited one day to her lover, when the bliss of feeling that she was important in his eyes was exceptionally keen.|vɒljuːmz wɪtʃ ʃiː had ɛɡzɪbɪtɪd wɒn deɪ tuː hɜː lʌvə, wɛn ðə blɪs ɒv fiːlɪŋ ðat ʃiː wɒz ɪmpɔːtənt ɪn hɪz aɪz wɒz ɛksɛpʃənəli kiːn.
102516|15-000037|Morris replied with a passionate epistle, in which he asked to what, in Heaven's name, she wished to make up her mind.|mɒɹɪs ɹɪplaɪd wɪð eɪ paʃənət ɪpɪsəl, ɪn wɪtʃ hiː askt tuː wɒt, ɪn hɛvənz neɪm, ʃiː wɪʃt tuː meɪk ʌp hɜː maɪnd.
102517|15-000038|Had not her mind been made up two weeks before, and could it be possible that she entertained the idea of throwing him off?|had nɒt hɜː maɪnd biːn meɪd ʌp tuː wiːks bɪfɔː, and kʊd ɪt biː pɒsɪbəl ðat ʃiː ɛntəteɪnd ðə aɪdiə ɒv θɹəʊɪŋ hɪm ɒf?
102518|15-000039|Did she mean to break down at the very beginning of their ordeal, after all the promises of fidelity she had both given and extracted?|dɪd ʃiː miːn tuː bɹeɪk daʊn at ðə vɛɹi bɪɡɪnɪŋ ɒv ðeə ɔːdiəl, aftə ɔːl ðə pɹɒmɪsɪz ɒv fɪdɛlɪti ʃiː had bəʊθ ɡɪvən and ɛkstɹaktɪd?
102519|15-000040|And he gave an account of his own interview with her father -- an account not identical at all points with that offered in these pages.|and hiː ɡeɪv an ɐkaʊnt ɒv hɪz əʊn ɪntəvjuː wɪð hɜː fɑːðə -- an ɐkaʊnt nɒt aɪdɛntɪkəl at ɔːl pɔɪnts wɪð ðat ɒfəd ɪn ðiːz peɪdʒɪz.
102520|15-000041|"He was terribly violent," Morris wrote;| "hiː wɒz tɛɹɪbli vaɪələnt," mɒɹɪs ɹəʊt;
102521|15-000042|but you know my self-control.|bʌt juː nəʊ maɪ sɛlfkəntɹəʊl.

102523|15-000044|Catherine sent him, in answer to this, a note of three lines.|kaθɹɪn sɛnt hɪm, ɪn ansə tuː ðɪs, eɪ nəʊt ɒv θɹiː laɪnz.
102524|15-000045|I am in great trouble;|aɪ am ɪn ɡɹeɪt tɹʌbəl;

102526|15-000047|The idea of a struggle with her father, of setting up her will against his own, was heavy on her soul, and it kept her formally submissive, as a great physical weight keeps us motionless.|ðə aɪdiə ɒv eɪ stɹʌɡəl wɪð hɜː fɑːðə, ɒv sɛtɪŋ ʌp hɜː wɪl ɐɡɛnst hɪz əʊn, wɒz hɛvi ɒn hɜː səʊl, and ɪt kɛpt hɜː fɔːməli səbmɪsɪv, az eɪ ɡɹeɪt fɪzɪkəl weɪt kiːps ʌs məʊʃənləs.
102527|15-000048|It never entered into her mind to throw her lover off;|ɪt nɛvə ɛntəd ɪntʊ hɜː maɪnd tuː θɹəʊ hɜː lʌvə ɒf;
102528|15-000049|but from the first she tried to assure herself that there would be a peaceful way out of their difficulty.|bʌt fɹɒm ðə fɜːst ʃiː tɹaɪd tuː əʃʊə hɜːsɛlf ðat ðeə wʊd biː eɪ piːsfəl weɪ aʊt ɒv ðeə dɪfɪkʌlti.
102529|15-000050|The assurance was vague, for it contained no element of positive conviction that her father would change his mind.|ðə əʃʊəɹəns wɒz veɪɡ, fɔː ɪt kənteɪnd nəʊ ɛlɪmənt ɒv pɒzɪtɪv kənvɪkʃən ðat hɜː fɑːðə wʊd tʃeɪndʒ hɪz maɪnd.
102530|15-000051|She only had an idea that if she should be very good, the situation would in some mysterious manner improve.|ʃiː əʊnli had an aɪdiə ðat ɪf ʃiː ʃʊd biː vɛɹi ɡʊd, ðə sɪtʃuːeɪʃən wʊd ɪn sʌm mɪstiəɹiəs manə ɪmpɹuːv.
102531|15-000052|To be good, she must be patient, respectful, abstain from judging her father too harshly, and from committing any act of open defiance.|tuː biː ɡʊd, ʃiː mʌst biː peɪʃənt, ɹɪspɛktfəl, ɐbsteɪn fɹɒm dʒʌdʒɪŋ hɜː fɑːðə tuː hɑːʃli, and fɹɒm kəmɪtɪŋ ɛni akt ɒv əʊpən dɪfaɪəns.
102532|15-000053|He was perhaps right, after all, to think as he did;|hiː wɒz pəhaps ɹaɪt, aftə ɔːl, tuː θɪŋk az hiː dɪd;
102533|15-000054|by which Catherine meant not in the least that his judgement of Morris's motives in seeking to marry her was perhaps a just one, but that it was probably natural and proper that conscientious parents should be suspicious and even unjust.|baɪ wɪtʃ kaθɹɪn mɛnt nɒt ɪn ðə liːst ðat hɪz dʒʌdʒmənt ɒv mɒɹɪs məʊtɪvz ɪn siːkɪŋ tuː maɹi hɜː wɒz pəhaps eɪ dʒʌst wɒn, bʌt ðat ɪt wɒz pɹɒbəbli natʃəɹəl and pɹɒpə ðat kɒnsɪɛnʃəs peəɹənts ʃʊd biː səspɪʃəs and iːvən ʌndʒʌst.
102535|15-000056|Of course he could not know what she knew, how the purest love and truth were seated in the young man's eyes;|ɒv kɔːs hiː kʊd nɒt nəʊ wɒt ʃiː njuː, haʊ ðə pjʊəɹɪst lʌv and tɹuːθ wɜː siːtɪd ɪn ðə jʌŋ manz aɪz;
102536|15-000057|but Heaven, in its time, might appoint a way of bringing him to such knowledge.|bʌt hɛvən, ɪn ɪts taɪm, maɪt ɐpɔɪnt eɪ weɪ ɒv bɹɪŋɪŋ hɪm tuː sʌtʃ nɒlɪdʒ.
102537|15-000058|Catherine expected a good deal of Heaven, and referred to the skies the initiative, as the French say, in dealing with her dilemma.|kaθɹɪn ɛkspɛktɪd eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv hɛvən, and ɹɪfɜːd tuː ðə skaɪz ðə ɪnɪʃiətɪv, az ðə fɹɛntʃ seɪ, ɪn diːlɪŋ wɪð hɜː daɪlɛmə.
102538|15-000059|She could not imagine herself imparting any kind of knowledge to her father, there was something superior even in his injustice and absolute in his mistakes.|ʃiː kʊd nɒt ɪmadʒɪn hɜːsɛlf ɪmpɑːtɪŋ ɛni kaɪnd ɒv nɒlɪdʒ tuː hɜː fɑːðə, ðeə wɒz sʌmθɪŋ suːpiəɹɪə iːvən ɪn hɪz ɪndʒʌstɪs and absəluːt ɪn hɪz mɪsteɪks.
102540|15-000061|Poor Catherine would have been glad to regard misess Penniman as an illuminating agent, a part which this lady herself indeed was but imperfectly prepared to play.|pʊə kaθɹɪn wʊd hav biːn ɡlad tuː ɹɪɡɑːd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən az an ɪluːmɪneɪtɪŋ eɪdʒənt, eɪ pɑːt wɪtʃ ðɪs leɪdi hɜːsɛlf ɪndiːd wɒz bʌt ɪmpɜːfɛktlɪ pɹɪpeəd tuː pleɪ.
102541|15-000062|misess Penniman took too much satisfaction in the sentimental shadows of this little drama to have, for the moment, any great interest in dissipating them.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən tʊk tuː mʌtʃ satɪsfakʃən ɪn ðə sɛntɪmɛntəl ʃadəʊz ɒv ðɪs lɪtəl dɹɑːmə tuː hav, fɔː ðə məʊmənt, ɛni ɡɹeɪt ɪntɹɪst ɪn dɪsɪpeɪtɪŋ ðɛm.
102542|15-000063|She wished the plot to thicken, and the advice that she gave her niece tended, in her own imagination, to produce this resultimate.|ʃiː wɪʃt ðə plɒt tuː θɪkən, and ðə ɐdvaɪs ðat ʃiː ɡeɪv hɜː niːs tɛndɪd, ɪn hɜː əʊn ɪmadʒɪneɪʃən, tuː pɹədjuːs ðɪs ɹɪzʌltɪmət.
102543|15-000064|It was rather incoherent counsel, and from one day to another it contradicted itself;|ɪt wɒz ɹɑːðə ɪŋkəʊhiəɹənt kaʊnsəl, and fɹɒm wɒn deɪ tuː ɐnʌðə ɪt kɒntɹədɪktɪd ɪtsɛlf;
102544|15-000065|but it was pervaded by an earnest desire that Catherine should do something striking.|bʌt ɪt wɒz pəveɪdɪd baɪ an ɜːnɪst dɪzaɪə ðat kaθɹɪn ʃʊd duː sʌmθɪŋ stɹaɪkɪŋ.
102545|15-000066|You must act, my dear;|juː mʌst akt, maɪ diə;
102546|15-000067|"in your situation the great thing is to act," said misess Penniman, who found her niece altogether beneath her opportunities.| "ɪn jɔː sɪtʃuːeɪʃən ðə ɡɹeɪt θɪŋ ɪz tuː akt," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː faʊnd hɜː niːs ɔːltəɡɛðə bɪniːθ hɜː ɒpətjuːnɪtiz.
102547|15-000068|misess Penniman's real hope was that the girl would make a secret marriage, at which she should officiate as brideswoman or duenna.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz ɹiəl həʊp wɒz ðat ðə ɡɜːl wʊd meɪk eɪ siːkɹɪt maɹɪdʒ, at wɪtʃ ʃiː ʃʊd əfɪʃɪeɪt az bɹaɪdswʊmən ɔː djuːənə.
102548|15-000069|She had a vision of this ceremony being performed in some subterranean chapel -- subterranean chapels in New York were not frequent, but misess Penniman's imagination was not chilled by trifles -- and of the guilty couple -- she liked to think of poor Catherine and her suitor as the guilty couple -- being shuffled away in a fast-whirling vehicle to some obscure lodging in the suburbs, where she would pay them (in a thick veil) clandestine visits, where they would endure a period of romantic privation, and where ultimately, after she should have been their earthly providence, their intercessor, their advocate, and their medium of communication with the world, they should be reconciled to her brother in an artistic tableau, in which she herself should be somehow the central figure.|ʃiː had eɪ vɪʒən ɒv ðɪs sɛɹɪməni biːɪŋ pəfɔːmd ɪn sʌm sʌbtɪɹeɪniən tʃapəl -- sʌbtɪɹeɪniən tʃapəlz ɪn njuː jɔːk wɜː nɒt fɹiːkwənt, bʌt mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz ɪmadʒɪneɪʃən wɒz nɒt tʃɪld baɪ tɹaɪfəlz -- and ɒv ðə ɡɪlti kʌpəl -- ʃiː laɪkt tuː θɪŋk ɒv pʊə kaθɹɪn and hɜː suːtə az ðə ɡɪlti kʌpəl -- biːɪŋ ʃʌfəld ɐweɪ ɪn eɪ fastwɜːlɪŋ viəkəl tuː sʌm ɒbskjʊə lɒdʒɪŋ ɪn ðə sʌbɜːbz, weə ʃiː wʊd peɪ ðɛm (ɪn eɪ θɪk veɪl) klandɛstɪn vɪzɪts, weə ðeɪ wʊd ɛndjʊə eɪ piəɹɪəd ɒv ɹəʊmantɪk pɹaɪveɪʃən, and weə ʌltɪmətli, aftə ʃiː ʃʊd hav biːn ðeə ɜːθli pɹɒvɪdəns, ðeə ɪntəsɛsə, ðeə advəkeɪt, and ðeə miːdiəm ɒv kəmjuːnɪkeɪʃən wɪð ðə wɜːld, ðeɪ ʃʊd biː ɹɛkənsaɪld tuː hɜː bɹʌðə ɪn an ɑːtɪstɪk tabləʊ, ɪn wɪtʃ ʃiː hɜːsɛlf ʃʊd biː sʌmhaʊ ðə sɛntɹəl fɪɡə.
102550|15-000071|She was in daily communication with the young man, whom she kept informed by letters of the state of affairs in Washington Square.|ʃiː wɒz ɪn deɪli kəmjuːnɪkeɪʃən wɪð ðə jʌŋ man, huːm ʃiː kɛpt ɪnfɔːmd baɪ lɛtəz ɒv ðə steɪt ɒv ɐfeəz ɪn wɒʃɪŋtən skweə.
102551|15-000072|As he had been banished, as she said, from the house, she no longer saw him;|az hiː had biːn banɪʃt, az ʃiː sɛd, fɹɒm ðə haʊs, ʃiː nəʊ lɒŋɡə sɔː hɪm;
102552|15-000073|but she ended by writing to him that she longed for an interview.|bʌt ʃiː ɛndɪd baɪ ɹaɪtɪŋ tuː hɪm ðat ʃiː lɒŋd fɔː an ɪntəvjuː.
102553|15-000074|This interview could take place only on neutral ground, and she bethought herself greatly before selecting a place of meeting.|ðɪs ɪntəvjuː kʊd teɪk pleɪs əʊnli ɒn njuːtɹəl ɡɹaʊnd, and ʃiː bɛθɔːt hɜːsɛlf ɡɹeɪtli bɪfɔː sɪlɛktɪŋ eɪ pleɪs ɒv miːtɪŋ.
102554|15-000075|She had an inclination for Greenwood Cemetery, but she gave it up as too distant;|ʃiː had an ɪŋklɪneɪʃən fɔː ɡɹiːnwʊd sɛmɪtəɹi, bʌt ʃiː ɡeɪv ɪt ʌp az tuː dɪstənt;
102555|15-000076|she could not absent herself for so long, as she said, without exciting suspicion.|ʃiː kʊd nɒt absənt hɜːsɛlf fɔː səʊ lɒŋ, az ʃiː sɛd, wɪðaʊt ɛksaɪtɪŋ səspɪʃən.
102556|15-000077|Then she thought of the Battery, but that was rather cold and windy, besides one's being exposed to intrusion from the Irish emigrants who at this point alight, with large appetites, in the New World and at last she fixed upon an oyster saloon in the Seventh Avenue, kept by a negro -- an establishment of which she knew nothing save that she had noticed it in passing.|ðɛn ʃiː θɔːt ɒv ðə batəɹi, bʌt ðat wɒz ɹɑːðə kəʊld and wɪndi, bɪsaɪdz wɒnz biːɪŋ ɛkspəʊzd tuː ɪntɹuːʒən fɹɒm ðə aɪɹɪʃ ɛmɪɡɹənts huː at ðɪs pɔɪnt ɐlaɪt, wɪð lɑːdʒ apɪtaɪts, ɪn ðə njuː wɜːld and at last ʃiː fɪkst əpɒn an ɔɪstə sɐluːn ɪn ðə sɛvənθ avənjuː, kɛpt baɪ eɪ niːɡɹəʊ -- an ɪstablɪʃmənt ɒv wɪtʃ ʃiː njuː nʌθɪŋ seɪv ðat ʃiː had nəʊtɪst ɪt ɪn pasɪŋ.
102557|15-000078|She made an appointment with Morris Townsend to meet him there, and she went to the tryst at dusk, enveloped in an impenetrable veil.|ʃiː meɪd an ɐpɔɪntmənt wɪð mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd tuː miːt hɪm ðeə, and ʃiː wɛnt tuː ðə tɹɪst at dʌsk, ɛnvɛləpt ɪn an ɪmpɛnɪtɹəbəl veɪl.
102558|15-000079|He kept her waiting for half an hour -- he had almost the whole width of the city to traverse -- but she liked to wait, it seemed to intensify the situation.|hiː kɛpt hɜː weɪtɪŋ fɔː hɑːf an aʊə -- hiː had ɔːlməʊst ðə həʊl wɪtθ ɒv ðə sɪti tuː tɹɐvɜːs -- bʌt ʃiː laɪkt tuː weɪt, ɪt siːmd tuː ɪntɛnsɪfaɪ ðə sɪtʃuːeɪʃən.
102559|15-000080|She ordered a cup of tea, which proved excessively bad, and this gave her a sense that she was suffering in a romantic cause.|ʃiː ɔːdəd eɪ kʌp ɒv tiː, wɪtʃ pɹuːvd ɛksɛsɪvli bad, and ðɪs ɡeɪv hɜː eɪ sɛns ðat ʃiː wɒz sʌfəɹɪŋ ɪn eɪ ɹəʊmantɪk kɔːz.
102560|15-000081|When Morris at last arrived, they sat together for half an hour in the duskiest corner of a back shop;|wɛn mɒɹɪs at last ɐɹaɪvd, ðeɪ sat təɡɛðə fɔː hɑːf an aʊə ɪn ðə dʌskiɪst kɔːnə ɒv eɪ bak ʃɒp;
102561|15-000082|and it is hardly too much to say that this was the happiest half-hour that misess Penniman had known for years.|and ɪt ɪz hɑːdli tuː mʌtʃ tuː seɪ ðat ðɪs wɒz ðə hapɪɪst hɑːfaʊə ðat mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had nəʊn fɔː jiəz.
102562|15-000083|The situation was really thrilling, and it scarcely seemed to her a false note when her companion asked for an oyster stew, and proceeded to consume it before her eyes.|ðə sɪtʃuːeɪʃən wɒz ɹiəlɪ θɹɪlɪŋ, and ɪt skeəsli siːmd tuː hɜː eɪ fɒls nəʊt wɛn hɜː kəmpaniən askt fɔː an ɔɪstə stjuː, and pɹəsiːdɪd tuː kənsjuːm ɪt bɪfɔː hɜː aɪz.
102563|15-000084|Morris, indeed, needed all the satisfaction that stewed oysters could give him, for it may be intimated to the reader that he regarded misess Penniman in the light of a fifth wheel to his coach.|mɒɹɪs, ɪndiːd, niːdɪd ɔːl ðə satɪsfakʃən ðat stjuːd ɔɪstəz kʊd ɡɪv hɪm, fɔː ɪt meɪ biː ɪntɪmeɪtɪd tuː ðə ɹiːdə ðat hiː ɹɪɡɑːdɪd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɪn ðə laɪt ɒv eɪ fɪfθ wiːl tuː hɪz kəʊtʃ.
102564|15-000085|He was in a state of irritation natural to a gentleman of fine parts who had been snubbed in a benevolent attempt to confer a distinction upon a young woman of inferior characteristics, and the insinuating sympathy of this somewhat desiccated matron appeared to offer him no practical relief.|hiː wɒz ɪn eɪ steɪt ɒv ɪɹɪteɪʃən natʃəɹəl tuː eɪ dʒɛntəlmən ɒv faɪn pɑːts huː had biːn snʌbd ɪn eɪ bənɛvələnt ɐtɛmpt tuː kənfɜː eɪ dɪstɪŋkʃən əpɒn eɪ jʌŋ wʊmən ɒv ɪnfiəɹiə kaɹɪktəɹɪstɪks, and ðə ɪnsɪnjuːeɪtɪŋ sɪmpəθi ɒv ðɪs sʌmwɒt dɛsɪkeɪtɪd meɪtɹən ɐpiəd tuː ɒfə hɪm nəʊ pɹaktɪkəl ɹɪliːf.
102565|15-000086|He thought her a humbug, and he judged of humbugs with a good deal of confidence.|hiː θɔːt hɜː eɪ hʌmbʌɡ, and hiː dʒʌdʒd ɒv hʌmbʌɡz wɪð eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv kɒnfɪdəns.
102566|15-000087|He had listened and made himself agreeable to her at first, in order to get a footing in Washington Square;|hiː had lɪsənd and meɪd hɪmsɛlf ɐɡɹiːəbəl tuː hɜː at fɜːst, ɪn ɔːdə tuː ɡɛt eɪ fʊtɪŋ ɪn wɒʃɪŋtən skweə;

102568|15-000089|It would have gratified him to tell her that she was a fantastic old woman, and that he should like to put her into an omnibus and send her home.|ɪt wʊd hav ɡɹatɪfaɪd hɪm tuː tɛl hɜː ðat ʃiː wɒz eɪ fantastɪk əʊld wʊmən, and ðat hiː ʃʊd laɪk tuː pʊt hɜː ɪntʊ an ɒmnɪbəs and sɛnd hɜː həʊm.
102570|16-000001|they had of course immediately spoken of Catherine.|ðeɪ had ɒv kɔːs ɪmiːdɪətli spəʊkən ɒv kaθɹɪn.
102571|16-000002|"Did she send me a message, or -- or anything?" Morris asked.| "dɪd ʃiː sɛnd miː eɪ mɛsɪdʒ, ɔː -- ɔː ɛnɪθɪŋ?" mɒɹɪs askt.

102585|16-000016|"Well," said misess Penniman, "my brother's hard, intellectual nature."| "wɛl," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, "maɪ bɹʌðəz hɑːd, ɪntəlɛktʃuːəl neɪtʃə."
102586|16-000017|Oh, the devil!|əʊ, ðə dɛvəl!
102587|16-000018|"He is impervious to pity," misess Penniman added, by way of explanation.| "hiː ɪz ɪmpɜːviəs tuː pɪti," mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən adɪd, baɪ weɪ ɒv ɛksplɐneɪʃən.
102588|16-000019|Do you mean that he won't come round?|duː juː miːn ðat hiː wɒnt kʌm ɹaʊnd?
102589|16-000020|He will never be vanquished by argument.|hiː wɪl nɛvə biː vaŋkwɪʃt baɪ ɑːɡjuːmənt.
102590|16-000021|I have studied him.|aɪ hav stʌdid hɪm.
102591|16-000022|He will be vanquished only by the accomplished fact.|hiː wɪl biː vaŋkwɪʃt əʊnli baɪ ðə ɐkɒmplɪʃt fakt.
102592|16-000023|The accomplished fact?|ðə ɐkɒmplɪʃt fakt?
102593|16-000024|"He will come round afterwards," said misess Penniman, with extreme significance.| "hiː wɪl kʌm ɹaʊnd aftəwədz," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, wɪð ɛkstɹiːm sɪɡnɪfɪkəns.
102594|16-000025|He cares for nothing but facts;|hiː keəz fɔː nʌθɪŋ bʌt fakts;
102595|16-000026|he must be met by facts!|hiː mʌst biː mɛt baɪ fakts!
102596|16-000027|"Well," rejoined Morris, "it is a fact that I wish to marry his daughter."| "wɛl," ɹɪdʒɔɪnd mɒɹɪs, "ɪt ɪz eɪ fakt ðat aɪ wɪʃ tuː maɹi hɪz dɔːtə."
102597|16-000028|I met him with that the other day, but he was not at all vanquished.|aɪ mɛt hɪm wɪð ðat ðə ʌðə deɪ, bʌt hiː wɒz nɒt at ɔːl vaŋkwɪʃt.
102598|16-000029|misess Penniman was silent a little, and her smile beneath the shadow of her capacious bonnet, on the edge of which her black veil was arranged curtain-wise, fixed itself upon Morris's face with a still more tender brilliancy.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz saɪlənt eɪ lɪtəl, and hɜː smaɪl bɪniːθ ðə ʃadəʊ ɒv hɜː kəpeɪʃəs bɒnɪt, ɒn ðə ɛdʒ ɒv wɪtʃ hɜː blak veɪl wɒz ɐɹeɪndʒd kɜːtənwaɪz, fɪkst ɪtsɛlf əpɒn mɒɹɪs feɪs wɪð eɪ stɪl mɔː tɛndə bɹɪliənsi.

102600|16-000031|"Do you recommend that?" asked the young man, frowning heavily.| "duː juː ɹɛkəmɛnd ðat?" askt ðə jʌŋ man, fɹaʊnɪŋ hɛvili.
102601|16-000032|She was a little frightened, but she went on with considerable boldness.|ʃiː wɒz eɪ lɪtəl fɹaɪtənd, bʌt ʃiː wɛnt ɒn wɪð kənsɪdəɹəbəl bəʊldnəs.
102602|16-000033|That is the way I see it: a private marriage -- a private marriage.|ðat ɪz ðə weɪ aɪ siː ɪt: eɪ pɹaɪvət maɹɪdʒ -- eɪ pɹaɪvət maɹɪdʒ.
102603|16-000034|She repeated the phrase because she liked it.|ʃiː ɹɪpiːtɪd ðə fɹeɪz bɪkɒz ʃiː laɪkt ɪt.
102604|16-000035|Do you mean that I should carry Catherine off?|duː juː miːn ðat aɪ ʃʊd kaɹi kaθɹɪn ɒf?
102605|16-000036|What do they call it -- elope with her?|wɒt duː ðeɪ kɔːl ɪt -- ɪləʊp wɪð hɜː?
102606|16-000037|"It is not a crime when you are driven to it," said misess Penniman.| "ɪt ɪz nɒt eɪ kɹaɪm wɛn juː ɑː dɹɪvən tuː ɪt," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
102607|16-000038|My husband, as I have told you, was a distinguished clergyman;|maɪ hʌsbənd, az aɪ hav təʊld juː, wɒz eɪ dɪstɪŋɡwɪʃt klɜːdʒɪmən;
102608|16-000039|one of the most eloquent men of his day.|wɒn ɒv ðə məʊst ɛləkwənt mɛn ɒv hɪz deɪ.
102610|16-000041|He was so interested in their story.|hiː wɒz səʊ ɪntɹɪstɪd ɪn ðeə stɔːɹi.
102611|16-000042|He had no hesitation, and everything came out beautifully.|hiː had nəʊ hɛzɪteɪʃən, and ɛvɹɪθɪŋ keɪm aʊt bjuːtɪfəli.
102612|16-000043|The father was afterwards reconciled, and thought everything of the young man.|ðə fɑːðə wɒz aftəwədz ɹɛkənsaɪld, and θɔːt ɛvɹɪθɪŋ ɒv ðə jʌŋ man.
102613|16-000044|mister Penniman married them in the evening, about seven o'clock.|mɪstə pɛnɪmən maɹid ðɛm ɪn ðə iːvnɪŋ, ɐbaʊt sɛvən ɒklɒk.
102614|16-000045|The church was so dark, you could scarcely see;|ðə tʃɜːtʃ wɒz səʊ dɑːk, juː kʊd skeəsli siː;
102615|16-000046|and mister Penniman was intensely agitated;|and mɪstə pɛnɪmən wɒz ɪntɛnsli adʒɪteɪtɪd;
102616|16-000047|he was so sympathetic.|hiː wɒz səʊ sɪmpəθɛtɪk.
102617|16-000048|I don't believe he could have done it again.|aɪ dəʊnt bɪliːv hiː kʊd hav dʌn ɪt ɐɡɛn.
102618|16-000049|"Unfortunately Catherine and I have not mister Penniman to marry us," said Morris.| "ʌnfɔːtʃənətli kaθɹɪn and aɪ hav nɒt mɪstə pɛnɪmən tuː maɹi ʌs," sɛd mɒɹɪs.
102619|16-000050|"No, but you have me!" rejoined misess Penniman expressively.| "nəʊ, bʌt juː hav miː!" ɹɪdʒɔɪnd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɛkspɹɛsɪvli.
102620|16-000051|I can't perform the ceremony, but I can help you.|aɪ kant pəfɔːm ðə sɛɹɪməni, bʌt aɪ kan hɛlp juː.
102621|16-000052|I can watch.|aɪ kan wɒtʃ.
102622|16-000053|"The woman's an idiot," thought Morris;| "ðə wʊmənz an ɪdɪət," θɔːt mɒɹɪs;
102623|16-000054|but he was obliged to say something different.|bʌt hiː wɒz əblaɪdʒd tuː seɪ sʌmθɪŋ dɪfɹənt.
102624|16-000055|It was not, however, materially more civil.|ɪt wɒz nɒt, haʊɛvə, mətiəɹiəli mɔː sɪvəl.
102625|16-000056|Was it in order to tell me this that you requested I would meet you here?|wɒz ɪt ɪn ɔːdə tuː tɛl miː ðɪs ðat juː ɹɪkwɛstɪd aɪ wʊd miːt juː hiə?
102626|16-000057|misess Penniman had been conscious of a certain vagueness in her errand, and of not being able to offer him any very tangible reward for his long walk.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had biːn kɒnʃəs ɒv eɪ sɜːtən veɪɡnəs ɪn hɜː ɛɹənd, and ɒv nɒt biːɪŋ eɪbəl tuː ɒfə hɪm ɛni vɛɹi tandʒɪbəl ɹɪwɔːd fɔː hɪz lɒŋ wɔːk.
102627|16-000058|"I thought perhaps you would like to see one who is so near to Catherine," she observed, with considerable majesty.| "aɪ θɔːt pəhaps juː wʊd laɪk tuː siː wɒn huː ɪz səʊ niə tuː kaθɹɪn," ʃiː ɒbzɜːvd, wɪð kənsɪdəɹəbəl madʒɪsti.

102629|16-000060|Morris extended his empty hands with a melancholy smile.|mɒɹɪs ɛkstɛndɪd hɪz ɛmpti handz wɪð eɪ mɛləŋkɒli smaɪl.
102630|16-000061|I am greatly obliged to you, but I have nothing to send.|aɪ am ɡɹeɪtli əblaɪdʒd tuː juː, bʌt aɪ hav nʌθɪŋ tuː sɛnd.
102631|16-000062|"Haven't you a word?" asked his companion, with her suggestive smile coming back.| "havənt juː eɪ wɜːd?" askt hɪz kəmpaniən, wɪð hɜː sədʒɛstɪv smaɪl kʌmɪŋ bak.
102632|16-000063|Morris frowned again.|mɒɹɪs fɹaʊnd ɐɡɛn.
102633|16-000064|"Tell her to hold fast," he said rather curtly.| "tɛl hɜː tuː həʊld fast," hiː sɛd ɹɑːðə kɜːtli.
102634|16-000065|That is a good word -- a noble word.|ðat ɪz eɪ ɡʊd wɜːd -- eɪ nəʊbəl wɜːd.
102635|16-000066|It will make her happy for many days.|ɪt wɪl meɪk hɜː hapi fɔː mɛni deɪz.
102636|16-000067|"She is very touching, very brave," misess Penniman went on, arranging her mantle and preparing to depart.| "ʃiː ɪz vɛɹi tʌtʃɪŋ, vɛɹi bɹeɪv," mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɛnt ɒn, ɐɹeɪndʒɪŋ hɜː mantəl and pɹɪpeəɹɪŋ tuː dɪpɑːt.
102637|16-000068|While she was so engaged she had an inspiration.|waɪl ʃiː wɒz səʊ ɛŋɡeɪdʒd ʃiː had an ɪnspəɹeɪʃən.
102638|16-000069|She found the phrase that she could boldly offer as a vindication of the step she had taken.|ʃiː faʊnd ðə fɹeɪz ðat ʃiː kʊd bəʊldli ɒfə az eɪ vɪndɪkeɪʃən ɒv ðə stɛp ʃiː had teɪkən.
102639|16-000070|"If you marry Catherine at all risks" she said, "you will give my brother a proof of your being what he pretends to doubt."| "ɪf juː maɹi kaθɹɪn at ɔːl ɹɪsks" ʃiː sɛd, "juː wɪl ɡɪv maɪ bɹʌðə eɪ pɹuːf ɒv jɔː biːɪŋ wɒt hiː pɹɪtɛndz tuː daʊt."
102640|16-000071|What he pretends to doubt?|wɒt hiː pɹɪtɛndz tuː daʊt?
102641|16-000072|"Don't you know what that is?" misess Penniman asked almost playfully.| "dəʊnt juː nəʊ wɒt ðat ɪz?" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən askt ɔːlməʊst pleɪfəli.
102642|16-000073|"It does not concern me to know," said Morris grandly.| "ɪt dʌz nɒt kənsɜːn miː tuː nəʊ," sɛd mɒɹɪs ɡɹandli.
102643|16-000074|Of course it makes you angry.|ɒv kɔːs ɪt meɪks juː aŋɡɹi.
102644|16-000075|"I despise it," Morris declared.| "aɪ dɪspaɪz ɪt," mɒɹɪs dɪkleəd.
102645|16-000076|"Ah, you know what it is, then?" said misess Penniman, shaking her finger at him.| "ɑː, juː nəʊ wɒt ɪt ɪz, ðɛn?" sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, ʃeɪkɪŋ hɜː fɪŋɡə at hɪm.
102646|16-000077|He pretends that you like -- you like the money.|hiː pɹɪtɛndz ðat juː laɪk -- juː laɪk ðə mʌni.
102649|16-000080|Ah, but not -- but not as he means it.|ɑː, bʌt nɒt -- bʌt nɒt az hiː miːnz ɪt.
102650|16-000081|You don't like it more than Catherine?|juː dəʊnt laɪk ɪt mɔː ðɐn kaθɹɪn?
102651|16-000082|He leaned his elbows on the table and buried his head in his hands.|hiː liːnd hɪz ɛlbəʊz ɒn ðə teɪbəl and bɛɹid hɪz hɛd ɪn hɪz handz.
102652|16-000083|"You torture me!" he murmured.| "juː tɔːtʃə miː!" hiː mɜːməd.
102653|16-000084|And, indeed, this was almost the effect of the poor lady's too importunate interest in his situation.|and, ɪndiːd, ðɪs wɒz ɔːlməʊst ðə ɪfɛkt ɒv ðə pʊə leɪdiz tuː ɪmpɔːtʌneɪt ɪntɹɪst ɪn hɪz sɪtʃuːeɪʃən.
102654|16-000085|But she insisted on making her point.|bʌt ʃiː ɪnsɪstɪd ɒn meɪkɪŋ hɜː pɔɪnt.
102655|16-000086|If you marry her in spite of him, he will take for granted that you expect nothing of him, and are prepared to do without it.|ɪf juː maɹi hɜː ɪn spaɪt ɒv hɪm, hiː wɪl teɪk fɔː ɡɹantɪd ðat juː ɛkspɛkt nʌθɪŋ ɒv hɪm, and ɑː pɹɪpeəd tuː duː wɪðaʊt ɪt.
102656|16-000087|And so he will see that you are disinterested.|and səʊ hiː wɪl siː ðat juː ɑː dɪsɪntɹɪstɪd.
102657|16-000088|Morris raised his head a little, following this argument, "And what shall I gain by that?"|mɒɹɪs ɹeɪzd hɪz hɛd eɪ lɪtəl, fɒləʊɪŋ ðɪs ɑːɡjuːmənt, "and wɒt ʃal aɪ ɡeɪn baɪ ðat?"
102659|16-000090|And seeing that I wish he would go to the deuce with it, he will leave it to a hospital.|and siːɪŋ ðat aɪ wɪʃ hiː wʊd ɡəʊ tuː ðə djuːs wɪð ɪt, hiː wɪl liːv ɪt tuː eɪ hɒspɪtəl.
102660|16-000091|"Is that what you mean?" asked Morris.| "ɪz ðat wɒt juː miːn?" askt mɒɹɪs.
102661|16-000092|No, I don't mean that;|nəʊ, aɪ dəʊnt miːn ðat;
102662|16-000093|"though that would be very grand!" misess Penniman quickly added.| "ðəʊ ðat wʊd biː vɛɹi ɡɹand!" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən kwɪkli adɪd.
102663|16-000094|I mean that having done you such an injustice, he will think it his duty, at the end, to make some amends.|aɪ miːn ðat havɪŋ dʌn juː sʌtʃ an ɪndʒʌstɪs, hiː wɪl θɪŋk ɪt hɪz djuːti, at ðə ɛnd, tuː meɪk sʌm ɐmɛndz.
102664|16-000095|Morris shook his head, though it must be confessed he was a little struck with this idea.|mɒɹɪs ʃʊk hɪz hɛd, ðəʊ ɪt mʌst biː kənfɛst hiː wɒz eɪ lɪtəl stɹʌk wɪð ðɪs aɪdiə.
102665|16-000096|Do you think he is so sentimental?|duː juː θɪŋk hiː ɪz səʊ sɛntɪmɛntəl?
102666|16-000097|"He is not sentimental," said misess Penniman;| "hiː ɪz nɒt sɛntɪmɛntəl," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən;
102667|16-000098|but, to be perfectly fair to him, I think he has, in his own narrow way, a certain sense of duty.|bʌt, tuː biː pɜːfɛktlɪ feə tuː hɪm, aɪ θɪŋk hiː haz, ɪn hɪz əʊn naɹəʊ weɪ, eɪ sɜːtən sɛns ɒv djuːti.

102670|16-000101|Ah, but he has duties to Catherine.|ɑː, bʌt hiː haz djuːtiz tuː kaθɹɪn.
102671|16-000102|Yes, but you see that on that principle Catherine has duties to him as well.|jɛs, bʌt juː siː ðat ɒn ðat pɹɪnsɪpəl kaθɹɪn haz djuːtiz tuː hɪm az wɛl.
102672|16-000103|misess Penniman got up, with a melancholy sigh, as if she thought him very unimaginative.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɡɒt ʌp, wɪð eɪ mɛləŋkɒli saɪ, az ɪf ʃiː θɔːt hɪm vɛɹi ʌnɪmadʒɪnətɪv.

102674|16-000105|"and now, do you think she has no duties to you?" misess Penniman always, even in conversation, italicised her personal pronouns.| "and naʊ, duː juː θɪŋk ʃiː haz nəʊ djuːtiz tuː juː?" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɔːlweɪz, iːvən ɪn kɒnvəseɪʃən, ɪtalɪsaɪzd hɜː pɜːsənəl pɹəʊnaʊnz.
102675|16-000106|It would sound harsh to say so!|ɪt wʊd saʊnd hɑːʃ tuː seɪ səʊ!

102677|16-000108|I will tell her you said that!|aɪ wɪl tɛl hɜː juː sɛd ðat!

102680|16-000111|Morris looked some moments at the sanded floor of the shop;|mɒɹɪs lʊkt sʌm məʊmənts at ðə sandɪd flɔː ɒv ðə ʃɒp;
102681|16-000112|he seemed to be disposed to linger a moment.|hiː siːmd tuː biː dɪspəʊzd tuː lɪŋɡə eɪ məʊmənt.
102682|16-000113|At last, looking up with a certain abruptness, "It is your belief that if she marries me he will cut her off?" he asked.|at last, lʊkɪŋ ʌp wɪð eɪ sɜːtən ɐbɹʌptnəs, "ɪt ɪz jɔː bɪliːf ðat ɪf ʃiː maɹiz miː hiː wɪl kʌt hɜː ɒf?" hiː askt.
102683|16-000114|misess Penniman stared a little, and smiled.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən steəd eɪ lɪtəl, and smaɪld.

102686|16-000117|It doesn't depend upon her, but upon you.|ɪt dʌzənt dɪpɛnd əpɒn hɜː, bʌt əpɒn juː.

102688|16-000119|Morris dropped his eyes on the sanded floor again, pondering this;|mɒɹɪs dɹɒpt hɪz aɪz ɒn ðə sandɪd flɔː ɐɡɛn, pɒndəɹɪŋ ðɪs;

102702|16-000133|And you believe he would certainly change it -- as regards Catherine?|and juː bɪliːv hiː wʊd sɜːtənli tʃeɪndʒ ɪt -- az ɹɪɡɑːdz kaθɹɪn?
102703|16-000134|Yes; and then change it back again.|jɛs; and ðɛn tʃeɪndʒ ɪt bak ɐɡɛn.
102704|16-000135|"Ah, but one can't depend on that!" said Morris.| "ɑː, bʌt wɒn kant dɪpɛnd ɒn ðat!" sɛd mɒɹɪs.
102705|16-000136|"Do you want to depend on it?" misess Penniman asked.| "duː juː wɒnt tuː dɪpɛnd ɒn ɪt?" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən askt.
102706|16-000137|Morris blushed a little.|mɒɹɪs blʌʃt eɪ lɪtəl.
102707|16-000138|Well, I am certainly afraid of being the cause of an injury to Catherine.|wɛl, aɪ am sɜːtənli ɐfɹeɪd ɒv biːɪŋ ðə kɔːz ɒv an ɪndʒəɹi tuː kaθɹɪn.
102708|16-000139|Ah! you must not be afraid.|ɑː! juː mʌst nɒt biː ɐfɹeɪd.
102709|16-000140|Be afraid of nothing, and everything will go well!|biː ɐfɹeɪd ɒv nʌθɪŋ, and ɛvɹɪθɪŋ wɪl ɡəʊ wɛl!
102710|16-000141|And then misess Penniman paid for her cup of tea, and Morris paid for his oyster stew, and they went out together into the dimly-lighted wilderness of the Seventh Avenue.|and ðɛn mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən peɪd fɔː hɜː kʌp ɒv tiː, and mɒɹɪs peɪd fɔː hɪz ɔɪstə stjuː, and ðeɪ wɛnt aʊt təɡɛðə ɪntʊ ðə dɪmlɪlaɪtɪd wɪldənəs ɒv ðə sɛvənθ avənjuː.
102711|16-000142|The dusk had closed in completely and the street lamps were separated by wide intervals of a pavement in which cavities and fissures played a disproportionate part.|ðə dʌsk had kləʊzd ɪn kəmpliːtli and ðə stɹiːt lamps wɜː sɛpəɹeɪtɪd baɪ waɪd ɪntəvəlz ɒv eɪ peɪvmənt ɪn wɪtʃ kavɪtiz and fɪʃəz pleɪd eɪ dɪspɹəpɔːʃənət pɑːt.
102712|16-000143|An omnibus, emblazoned with strange pictures, went tumbling over the dislocated cobble-stones.|an ɒmnɪbəs, ɛmbleɪzənd wɪð stɹeɪndʒ pɪktʃəz, wɛnt tʌmblɪŋ əʊvə ðə dɪsləʊkeɪtɪd kɒbəlstəʊnz.
102713|16-000144|How will you go home?|haʊ wɪl juː ɡəʊ həʊm?
102714|16-000145|Morris asked, following this vehicle with an interested eye.|mɒɹɪs askt, fɒləʊɪŋ ðɪs viəkəl wɪð an ɪntɹɪstɪd aɪ.
102715|16-000146|misess Penniman had taken his arm.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had teɪkən hɪz ɑːm.
102716|16-000147|She hesitated a moment.|ʃiː hɛzɪteɪtɪd eɪ məʊmənt.
102717|16-000148|"I think this manner would be pleasant," she said;| "aɪ θɪŋk ðɪs manə wʊd biː plɛzənt," ʃiː sɛd;
102718|16-000149|and she continued to let him feel the value of his support.|and ʃiː kəntɪnjuːd tuː lɛt hɪm fiːl ðə valjuː ɒv hɪz səpɔːt.
102719|16-000150|So he walked with her through the devious ways of the west side of the town, and through the bustle of gathering nightfall in populous streets, to the quiet precinct of Washington Square.|səʊ hiː wɔːkt wɪð hɜː θɹuː ðə diːviəs weɪz ɒv ðə wɛst saɪd ɒv ðə taʊn, and θɹuː ðə bʌsəl ɒv ɡaðəɹɪŋ naɪtfɔːl ɪn pɒpjʊləs stɹiːts, tuː ðə kwaɪət pɹiːsɪŋkt ɒv wɒʃɪŋtən skweə.
102720|16-000151|They lingered a moment at the foot of doctor Sloper's white marble steps, above which a spotless white door, adorned with a glittering silver plate, seemed to figure, for Morris, the closed portal of happiness;|ðeɪ lɪŋɡəd eɪ məʊmənt at ðə fʊt ɒv dɒktə sləʊpəz waɪt mɑːbəl stɛps, əbʌv wɪtʃ eɪ spɒtləs waɪt dɔː, ɐdɔːnd wɪð eɪ ɡlɪtəɹɪŋ sɪlvə pleɪt, siːmd tuː fɪɡə, fɔː mɒɹɪs, ðə kləʊzd pɔːtəl ɒv hapɪnəs;
102721|16-000152|and then misess Penniman's companion rested a melancholy eye upon a lighted window in the upper part of the house.|and ðɛn mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz kəmpaniən ɹɛstɪd eɪ mɛləŋkɒli aɪ əpɒn eɪ laɪtɪd wɪndəʊ ɪn ðə ʌpə pɑːt ɒv ðə haʊs.
102722|16-000153|"That is my room -- my dear little room!" misess Penniman remarked.| "ðat ɪz maɪ ɹuːm -- maɪ diə lɪtəl ɹuːm!" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɹɪmɑːkt.
102723|16-000154|Morris started.|mɒɹɪs stɑːtɪd.
102724|16-000155|Then I needn't come walking round the Square to gaze at it.|ðɛn aɪ niːdnt kʌm wɔːkɪŋ ɹaʊnd ðə skweə tuː ɡeɪz at ɪt.
102725|16-000156|That's as you please.|ðats az juː pliːz.
102726|16-000157|But Catherine's is behind;|bʌt kaθɹɪnz ɪz bɪhaɪnd;
102727|16-000158|two noble windows on the second floor.|tuː nəʊbəl wɪndəʊz ɒn ðə sɛkənd flɔː.
102728|16-000159|I think you can see them from the other street.|aɪ θɪŋk juː kan siː ðɛm fɹɒm ðə ʌðə stɹiːt.
102729|16-000160|I don't want to see them, ma'am!|aɪ dəʊnt wɒnt tuː siː ðɛm, mɑːm!
102730|16-000161|And Morris turned his back to the house.|and mɒɹɪs tɜːnd hɪz bak tuː ðə haʊs.
102732|16-000163|and I will give her your message -- that she is to hold fast!|and aɪ wɪl ɡɪv hɜː jɔː mɛsɪdʒ -- ðat ʃiː ɪz tuː həʊld fast!
102733|16-000164|Oh, yes!|əʊ, jɛs!
102734|16-000165|of course.|ɒv kɔːs.
102735|16-000166|You know I write her all that.|juː nəʊ aɪ ɹaɪt hɜː ɔːl ðat.
102736|16-000167|It seems to say more when it is spoken!|ɪt siːmz tuː seɪ mɔː wɛn ɪt ɪz spəʊkən!
102737|16-000168|"And remember, if you need me, that I am there";| "and ɹɪmɛmbə, ɪf juː niːd miː, ðat aɪ am ðeə";
102738|16-000169|and misess Penniman glanced at the third floor.|and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɡlanst at ðə θɜːd flɔː.
102739|16-000170|On this they separated, and Morris, left to himself, stood looking at the house a moment;|ɒn ðɪs ðeɪ sɛpəɹeɪtɪd, and mɒɹɪs, lɛft tuː hɪmsɛlf, stʊd lʊkɪŋ at ðə haʊs eɪ məʊmənt;
102740|16-000171|after which he turned away, and took a gloomy walk round the Square, on the opposite side, close to the wooden fence.|aftə wɪtʃ hiː tɜːnd ɐweɪ, and tʊk eɪ ɡluːmi wɔːk ɹaʊnd ðə skweə, ɒn ðə ɒpəzɪt saɪd, kləʊs tuː ðə wʊdən fɛns.
102741|16-000172|Then he came back, and paused for a minute in front of doctor Sloper's dwelling.|ðɛn hiː keɪm bak, and pɔːzd fɔː eɪ mɪnɪt ɪn fɹʌnt ɒv dɒktə sləʊpəz dwɛlɪŋ.
102742|16-000173|His eyes travelled over it;|hɪz aɪz tɹavəld əʊvə ɪt;
102743|16-000174|they even rested on the ruddy windows of misess Penniman's apartment.|ðeɪ iːvən ɹɛstɪd ɒn ðə ɹʌdi wɪndəʊz ɒv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz ɐpɑːtmənt.
102745|17-000002|and on receiving this news the girl started with a sense of pain.|and ɒn ɹɪsiːvɪŋ ðɪs njuːz ðə ɡɜːl stɑːtɪd wɪð eɪ sɛns ɒv peɪn.
102746|17-000003|She felt angry for the moment;|ʃiː fɛlt aŋɡɹi fɔː ðə məʊmənt;
102747|17-000004|it was almost the first time she had ever felt angry.|ɪt wɒz ɔːlməʊst ðə fɜːst taɪm ʃiː had ɛvə fɛlt aŋɡɹi.
102748|17-000005|It seemed to her that her aunt was meddlesome;|ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː ðat hɜː ant wɒz mɛdəlsʌm;
102749|17-000006|and from this came a vague apprehension that she would spoil something.|and fɹɒm ðɪs keɪm eɪ veɪɡ apɹɪhɛnʃən ðat ʃiː wʊd spɔɪl sʌmθɪŋ.
102750|17-000007|I don't see why you should have seen him.|aɪ dəʊnt siː waɪ juː ʃʊd hav siːn hɪm.
102751|17-000008|"I don't think it was right," Catherine said.| "aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk ɪt wɒz ɹaɪt," kaθɹɪn sɛd.
102752|17-000009|I was so sorry for him -- it seemed to me some one ought to see him.|aɪ wɒz səʊ sɒɹi fɔː hɪm -- ɪt siːmd tuː miː sʌm wɒn ɔːt tuː siː hɪm.
102753|17-000010|"No one but I," said Catherine, who felt as if she were making the most presumptuous speech of her life, and yet at the same time had an instinct that she was right in doing so.| "nəʊ wɒn bʌt aɪ," sɛd kaθɹɪn, huː fɛlt az ɪf ʃiː wɜː meɪkɪŋ ðə məʊst pɹɪsʌmptʃuːəs spiːtʃ ɒv hɜː laɪf, and jɛt at ðə seɪm taɪm had an ɪnstɪŋkt ðat ʃiː wɒz ɹaɪt ɪn duːɪŋ səʊ.
102754|17-000011|"But you wouldn't, my dear," Aunt Lavinia rejoined;| "bʌt juː wʊdnt, maɪ diə," ant lavɪniə ɹɪdʒɔɪnd;
102755|17-000012|and I didn't know what might have become of him.|and aɪ dɪdnt nəʊ wɒt maɪt hav bɪkʌm ɒv hɪm.
102756|17-000013|"I have not seen him, because my father has forbidden it," Catherine said very simply.| "aɪ hav nɒt siːn hɪm, bɪkɒz maɪ fɑːðə haz fəbɪdən ɪt," kaθɹɪn sɛd vɛɹi sɪmpli.
102757|17-000014|There was a simplicity in this, indeed, which fairly vexed misess Penniman.|ðeə wɒz eɪ sɪmplɪsɪti ɪn ðɪs, ɪndiːd, wɪtʃ feəli vɛkst mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
102759|17-000016|Catherine looked at her.|kaθɹɪn lʊkt at hɜː.
102760|17-000017|I don't understand you.|aɪ dəʊnt ʌndəstand juː.
102761|17-000018|You seem to be very strange.|juː siːm tuː biː vɛɹi stɹeɪndʒ.
102762|17-000019|Well, my dear, you will understand me some day!|wɛl, maɪ diə, juː wɪl ʌndəstand miː sʌm deɪ!
102763|17-000020|And misess Penniman, who was reading the evening paper, which she perused daily from the first line to the last, resumed her occupation.|and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː wɒz ɹiːdɪŋ ðə iːvnɪŋ peɪpə, wɪtʃ ʃiː pəɹuːzd deɪli fɹɒm ðə fɜːst laɪn tuː ðə last, ɹɪzjuːmd hɜː ɒkjʊpeɪʃən.
102764|17-000021|She wrapped herself in silence;|ʃiː ɹapt hɜːsɛlf ɪn saɪləns;
102765|17-000022|she was determined Catherine should ask her for an account of her interview with Morris.|ʃiː wɒz dɪtɜːmɪnd kaθɹɪn ʃʊd ask hɜː fɔː an ɐkaʊnt ɒv hɜː ɪntəvjuː wɪð mɒɹɪs.
102766|17-000023|But Catherine was silent for so long, that she almost lost patience;|bʌt kaθɹɪn wɒz saɪlənt fɔː səʊ lɒŋ, ðat ʃiː ɔːlməʊst lɒst peɪʃəns;
102767|17-000024|and she was on the point of remarking to her that she was very heartless, when the girl at last spoke.|and ʃiː wɒz ɒn ðə pɔɪnt ɒv ɹɪmɑːkɪŋ tuː hɜː ðat ʃiː wɒz vɛɹi hɑːtləs, wɛn ðə ɡɜːl at last spəʊk.
102768|17-000025|"What did he say?" she asked.| "wɒt dɪd hiː seɪ?" ʃiː askt.
102769|17-000026|He said he is ready to marry you any day, in spite of everything.|hiː sɛd hiː ɪz ɹɛdi tuː maɹi juː ɛni deɪ, ɪn spaɪt ɒv ɛvɹɪθɪŋ.
102770|17-000027|Catherine made no answer to this, and misess Penniman almost lost patience again;|kaθɹɪn meɪd nəʊ ansə tuː ðɪs, and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɔːlməʊst lɒst peɪʃəns ɐɡɛn;
102771|17-000028|owing to which she at last volunteered the information that Morris looked very handsome, but terribly haggard.|əʊɪŋ tuː wɪtʃ ʃiː at last vɒləntiəd ðə ɪnfəmeɪʃən ðat mɒɹɪs lʊkt vɛɹi handsʌm, bʌt tɛɹɪbli haɡəd.
102772|17-000029|"Did he seem sad?" asked her niece.| "dɪd hiː siːm sad?" askt hɜː niːs.
102773|17-000030|"He was dark under the eyes," said misess Penniman.| "hiː wɒz dɑːk ʌndə ðə aɪz," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
102774|17-000031|So different from when I first saw him;|səʊ dɪfɹənt fɹɒm wɛn aɪ fɜːst sɔː hɪm;

102778|17-000035|"Where did you see him?" she asked presently.| "weə dɪd juː siː hɪm?" ʃiː askt pɹɛzəntli.
102780|17-000037|"at a confectioner's," said misess Penniman, who had a general idea that she ought to dissemble a little.| "at eɪ kənfɛkʃənəz," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː had eɪ dʒɛnəɹəl aɪdiə ðat ʃiː ɔːt tuː dɪsɛmbəl eɪ lɪtəl.
102781|17-000038|Whereabouts is the place?|weəɹɐbaʊts ɪz ðə pleɪs?
102782|17-000039|Catherine inquired, after another pause.|kaθɹɪn ɪŋkwaɪəd, aftə ɐnʌðə pɔːz.
102785|17-000042|"Why are you so dry, Catherine?" misess Penniman said at last.| "waɪ ɑː juː səʊ dɹaɪ, kaθɹɪn?" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən sɛd at last.
102786|17-000043|So dry?|səʊ dɹaɪ?
102787|17-000044|So cold -- so irresponsive.|səʊ kəʊld -- səʊ ɪɹɪspɒnsɪv.
102788|17-000045|The girl turned very quickly.|ðə ɡɜːl tɜːnd vɛɹi kwɪkli.
102789|17-000046|Did he say that?|dɪd hiː seɪ ðat?
102790|17-000047|misess Penniman hesitated a moment.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən hɛzɪteɪtɪd eɪ məʊmənt.
102791|17-000048|I will tell you what he said.|aɪ wɪl tɛl juː wɒt hiː sɛd.
102792|17-000049|He said he feared only one thing -- that you would be afraid.|hiː sɛd hiː fiəd əʊnli wɒn θɪŋ -- ðat juː wʊd biː ɐfɹeɪd.
102793|17-000050|Afraid of what?|ɐfɹeɪd ɒv wɒt?
102794|17-000051|Afraid of your father.|ɐfɹeɪd ɒv jɔː fɑːðə.
102795|17-000052|Catherine turned back to the fire again, and then, after a pause, she said -- "I am afraid of my father."|kaθɹɪn tɜːnd bak tuː ðə faɪə ɐɡɛn, and ðɛn, aftə eɪ pɔːz, ʃiː sɛd -- "aɪ am ɐfɹeɪd ɒv maɪ fɑːðə."
102796|17-000053|misess Penniman got quickly up from her chair and approached her niece.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɡɒt kwɪkli ʌp fɹɒm hɜː tʃeə and ɐpɹəʊtʃt hɜː niːs.
102797|17-000054|Do you mean to give him up, then?|duː juː miːn tuː ɡɪv hɪm ʌp, ðɛn?
102798|17-000055|Catherine for some time never moved;|kaθɹɪn fɔː sʌm taɪm nɛvə muːvd;
102799|17-000056|she kept her eyes on the coals.|ʃiː kɛpt hɜː aɪz ɒn ðə kəʊlz.

102801|17-000058|"Why do you push me so?" she asked.| "waɪ duː juː pʊʃ miː səʊ?" ʃiː askt.
102802|17-000059|I don't push you.|aɪ dəʊnt pʊʃ juː.

102805|17-000062|"I am afraid it is necessary, then, Catherine," said misess Penniman, with a good deal of solemnity.| "aɪ am ɐfɹeɪd ɪt ɪz nɛsɪsəɹi, ðɛn, kaθɹɪn," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, wɪð eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv sɒlɛmnɪti.
102806|17-000063|I am afraid you don't feel the importance.|aɪ am ɐfɹeɪd juː dəʊnt fiːl ðə ɪmpɔːtəns.
102807|17-000064|She paused a little;|ʃiː pɔːzd eɪ lɪtəl;

102810|17-000067|And misess Penniman went back to her chair, by the lamp, and, with a little jerk, picked up the evening paper again.|and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɛnt bak tuː hɜː tʃeə, baɪ ðə lamp, and, wɪð eɪ lɪtəl dʒɜːk, pɪkt ʌp ðə iːvnɪŋ peɪpə ɐɡɛn.
102811|17-000068|Catherine stood there before the fire, with her hands behind her, looking at her aunt, to whom it seemed that the girl had never had just this dark fixedness in her gaze.|kaθɹɪn stʊd ðeə bɪfɔː ðə faɪə, wɪð hɜː handz bɪhaɪnd hɜː, lʊkɪŋ at hɜː ant, tuː huːm ɪt siːmd ðat ðə ɡɜːl had nɛvə had dʒʌst ðɪs dɑːk fɪkstnəs ɪn hɜː ɡeɪz.

102816|17-000073|But misess Penniman's imagination was restless, and the evening paper failed on this occasion to enchain it.|bʌt mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz ɪmadʒɪneɪʃən wɒz ɹɛstləs, and ðə iːvnɪŋ peɪpə feɪld ɒn ðɪs əkeɪʒən tuː ɛntʃeɪn ɪt.

102823|17-000080|And misess Penniman gave a little sharp slap to her newspaper.|and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɡeɪv eɪ lɪtəl ʃɑːp slap tuː hɜː njuːzpeɪpə.
102824|17-000081|She knew not what to make of her niece, who had suddenly become stern and contradictious.|ʃiː njuː nɒt wɒt tuː meɪk ɒv hɜː niːs, huː had sʌdənli bɪkʌm stɜːn and kɒntɹədɪkʃəs.
102825|17-000082|This tendency on Catherine's part was presently even more apparent.|ðɪs tɛndənsi ɒn kaθɹɪnz pɑːt wɒz pɹɛzəntli iːvən mɔː ɐpaɹənt.
102826|17-000083|"You had much better not make any more appointments with mister Townsend," she said.| "juː had mʌtʃ bɛtə nɒt meɪk ɛni mɔː ɐpɔɪntmənts wɪð mɪstə taʊnsɛnd," ʃiː sɛd.
102827|17-000084|I don't think it is right.|aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk ɪt ɪz ɹaɪt.
102828|17-000085|misess Penniman rose with considerable majesty.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɹəʊz wɪð kənsɪdəɹəbəl madʒɪsti.
102829|17-000086|"My poor child, are you jealous of me?" she inquired.| "maɪ pʊə tʃaɪld, ɑː juː dʒɛləs ɒv miː?" ʃiː ɪŋkwaɪəd.
102830|17-000087|"Oh, Aunt Lavinia!" murmured Catherine, blushing.| "əʊ, ant lavɪniə!" mɜːməd kaθɹɪn, blʌʃɪŋ.
102831|17-000088|I don't think it is your place to teach me what is right.|aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk ɪt ɪz jɔː pleɪs tuː tiːtʃ miː wɒt ɪz ɹaɪt.
102833|17-000090|It can't be right to deceive.|ɪt kant biː ɹaɪt tuː dɪsiːv.
102834|17-000091|I certainly have not deceived you!|aɪ sɜːtənli hav nɒt dɪsiːvd juː!
102835|17-000092|Yes;|jɛs;
102836|17-000093|but I promised my father|bʌt aɪ pɹɒmɪst maɪ fɑːðə
102837|17-000094|I have no doubt you promised your father.|aɪ hav nəʊ daʊt juː pɹɒmɪst jɔː fɑːðə.
102838|17-000095|But I have promised him nothing!|bʌt aɪ hav pɹɒmɪst hɪm nʌθɪŋ!
102839|17-000096|Catherine had to admit this, and she did so in silence.|kaθɹɪn had tuː ɐdmɪt ðɪs, and ʃiː dɪd səʊ ɪn saɪləns.
102840|17-000097|"I don't believe mister Townsend himself likes it," she said at last.| "aɪ dəʊnt bɪliːv mɪstə taʊnsɛnd hɪmsɛlf laɪks ɪt," ʃiː sɛd at last.
102841|17-000098|Doesn't like meeting me?|dʌzənt laɪk miːtɪŋ miː?
102842|17-000099|Not in secret.|nɒt ɪn siːkɹɪt.
102843|17-000100|It was not in secret;|ɪt wɒz nɒt ɪn siːkɹɪt;
102844|17-000101|the place was full of people.|ðə pleɪs wɒz fʊl ɒv piːpəl.

102846|17-000103|misess Penniman flinched a little.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən flɪntʃt eɪ lɪtəl.
102847|17-000104|"Gentlemen enjoy such things," she remarked presently.| "dʒɛntəlmən ɛndʒɔɪ sʌtʃ θɪŋz," ʃiː ɹɪmɑːkt pɹɛzəntli.
102848|17-000105|I know what gentlemen like.|aɪ nəʊ wɒt dʒɛntəlmən laɪk.
102849|17-000106|My father wouldn't like it, if he knew.|maɪ fɑːðə wʊdnt laɪk ɪt, ɪf hiː njuː.
102850|17-000107|"Pray, do you propose to inform him?" misess Penniman inquired.| "pɹeɪ, duː juː pɹəpəʊz tuː ɪnfɔːm hɪm?" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɪŋkwaɪəd.
102851|17-000108|No, Aunt Lavinia.|nəʊ, ant lavɪniə.
102852|17-000109|But please don't do it again.|bʌt pliːz dəʊnt duː ɪt ɐɡɛn.

102854|17-000111|I do not share your dread of my brother;|aɪ duː nɒt ʃeə jɔː dɹɛd ɒv maɪ bɹʌðə;

102860|18-000001|catherine sat alone by the parlour fire -- sat there for more than an hour, lost in her meditations.|kaθɹɪn sat ɐləʊn baɪ ðə pɑːlə faɪə -- sat ðeə fɔː mɔː ðɐn an aʊə, lɒst ɪn hɜː mɛdɪteɪʃənz.
102861|18-000002|Her aunt seemed to her aggressive and foolish, and to see it so clearly -- to judge misess Penniman so positively -- made her feel old and grave.|hɜː ant siːmd tuː hɜː ɐɡɹɛsɪv and fuːlɪʃ, and tuː siː ɪt səʊ kliəli -- tuː dʒʌdʒ mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən səʊ pɒzɪtɪvli -- meɪd hɜː fiːl əʊld and ɡɹeɪv.
102862|18-000003|She did not resent the imputation of weakness;|ʃiː dɪd nɒt ɹɪzɛnt ðə ɪmpjuːteɪʃən ɒv wiːknəs;
102863|18-000004|it made no impression on her, for she had not the sense of weakness, and she was not hurt at not being appreciated.|ɪt meɪd nəʊ ɪmpɹɛʃən ɒn hɜː, fɔː ʃiː had nɒt ðə sɛns ɒv wiːknəs, and ʃiː wɒz nɒt hɜːt at nɒt biːɪŋ ɐpɹiːʃɪeɪtɪd.
102864|18-000005|She had an immense respect for her father, and she felt that to displease him would be a misdemeanour analogous to an act of profanity in a great temple;|ʃiː had an ɪmɛns ɹɪspɛkt fɔː hɜː fɑːðə, and ʃiː fɛlt ðat tuː dɪspliːz hɪm wʊd biː eɪ mɪsdɪmiːnə ɐnaləɡəs tuː an akt ɒv pɹəfanɪti ɪn eɪ ɡɹeɪt tɛmpəl;
102865|18-000006|but her purpose had slowly ripened, and she believed that her prayers had purified it of its violence.|bʌt hɜː pɜːpəs had sləʊli ɹaɪpənd, and ʃiː bɪliːvd ðat hɜː pɹeəz had pjʊəɹɪfaɪd ɪt ɒv ɪts vaɪələns.
102866|18-000007|The evening advanced, and the lamp burned dim without her noticing it;|ðə iːvnɪŋ ɐdvanst, and ðə lamp bɜːnd dɪm wɪðaʊt hɜː nəʊtɪsɪŋ ɪt;
102867|18-000008|her eyes were fixed upon her terrible plan.|hɜː aɪz wɜː fɪkst əpɒn hɜː tɛɹɪbəl plan.
102868|18-000009|She knew her father was in his study -- that he had been there all the evening;|ʃiː njuː hɜː fɑːðə wɒz ɪn hɪz stʌdi -- ðat hiː had biːn ðeə ɔːl ðə iːvnɪŋ;
102869|18-000010|from time to time she expected to hear him move.|fɹɒm taɪm tuː taɪm ʃiː ɛkspɛktɪd tuː hiə hɪm muːv.
102870|18-000011|She thought he would perhaps come, as he sometimes came, into the parlour.|ʃiː θɔːt hiː wʊd pəhaps kʌm, az hiː sʌmtaɪmz keɪm, ɪntʊ ðə pɑːlə.
102871|18-000012|At last the clock struck eleven, and the house was wrapped in silence;|at last ðə klɒk stɹʌk ɪlɛvən, and ðə haʊs wɒz ɹapt ɪn saɪləns;

102873|18-000014|Catherine got up and went slowly to the door of the library, where she waited a moment, motionless.|kaθɹɪn ɡɒt ʌp and wɛnt sləʊli tuː ðə dɔː ɒv ðə laɪbɹəɹi, weə ʃiː weɪtɪd eɪ məʊmənt, məʊʃənləs.
102874|18-000015|Then she knocked, and then she waited again.|ðɛn ʃiː nɒkt, and ðɛn ʃiː weɪtɪd ɐɡɛn.
102875|18-000016|Her father had answered her, but she had not the courage to turn the latch.|hɜː fɑːðə had ansəd hɜː, bʌt ʃiː had nɒt ðə kʌɹɪdʒ tuː tɜːn ðə latʃ.
102876|18-000017|What she had said to her aunt was true enough -- she was afraid of him;|wɒt ʃiː had sɛd tuː hɜː ant wɒz tɹuː ɪnʌf -- ʃiː wɒz ɐfɹeɪd ɒv hɪm;
102877|18-000018|and in saying that she had no sense of weakness she meant that she was not afraid of herself.|and ɪn seɪɪŋ ðat ʃiː had nəʊ sɛns ɒv wiːknəs ʃiː mɛnt ðat ʃiː wɒz nɒt ɐfɹeɪd ɒv hɜːsɛlf.
102878|18-000019|She heard him move within, and he came and opened the door for her.|ʃiː hɜːd hɪm muːv wɪðɪn, and hiː keɪm and əʊpənd ðə dɔː fɔː hɜː.
102879|18-000020|"What is the matter?" asked the Doctor.| "wɒt ɪz ðə matə?" askt ðə dɒktə.

102883|18-000024|His back was turned to her -- she began to hear the scratching of his pen.|hɪz bak wɒz tɜːnd tuː hɜː -- ʃiː bɪɡan tuː hiə ðə skɹatʃɪŋ ɒv hɪz pɛn.
102884|18-000025|She remained near the door, with her heart thumping beneath her bodice;|ʃiː ɹɪmeɪnd niə ðə dɔː, wɪð hɜː hɑːt θʌmpɪŋ bɪniːθ hɜː bɒdɪs;
102886|18-000027|At last she began, watching it while she spoke.|at last ʃiː bɪɡan, wɒtʃɪŋ ɪt waɪl ʃiː spəʊk.
102887|18-000028|You told me that if I should have anything more to say about mister Townsend you would be glad to listen to it.|juː təʊld miː ðat ɪf aɪ ʃʊd hav ɛnɪθɪŋ mɔː tuː seɪ ɐbaʊt mɪstə taʊnsɛnd juː wʊd biː ɡlad tuː lɪsən tuː ɪt.

102889|18-000030|Catherine wished it would go on, but she herself continued.|kaθɹɪn wɪʃt ɪt wʊd ɡəʊ ɒn, bʌt ʃiː hɜːsɛlf kəntɪnjuːd.

102894|18-000035|The Doctor wheeled slowly round in his chair, with a smile that seemed to accuse her of an epigram;|ðə dɒktə wiːld sləʊli ɹaʊnd ɪn hɪz tʃeə, wɪð eɪ smaɪl ðat siːmd tuː ɐkjuːz hɜː ɒv an ɛpɪɡɹam;

102897|18-000038|No, father, not that;|nəʊ, fɑːðə, nɒt ðat;

102900|18-000041|The Doctor slowly rubbed his under lip with the feather of his quill.|ðə dɒktə sləʊli ɹʌbd hɪz ʌndə lɪp wɪð ðə fɛðə ɒv hɪz kwɪl.

102904|18-000045|Once would have done that.|wʌns wʊd hav dʌn ðat.
102905|18-000046|"No," said Catherine;| "nəʊ," sɛd kaθɹɪn;

102908|18-000049|his eyes were so fine and cold.|hɪz aɪz wɜː səʊ faɪn and kəʊld.

102910|18-000051|Come here to your father.|kʌm hiə tuː jɔː fɑːðə.
102911|18-000052|And he got up, holding out his hands toward her.|and hiː ɡɒt ʌp, həʊldɪŋ aʊt hɪz handz təwɔːd hɜː.
102912|18-000053|The words were a surprise, and they gave her an exquisite joy.|ðə wɜːdz wɜː eɪ səpɹaɪz, and ðeɪ ɡeɪv hɜː an ɛkskwɪsɪt dʒɔɪ.
102913|18-000054|She went to him, and he put his arm round her tenderly, soothingly;|ʃiː wɛnt tuː hɪm, and hiː pʊt hɪz ɑːm ɹaʊnd hɜː tɛndəli, suːðɪŋli;
102914|18-000055|and then he kissed her.|and ðɛn hiː kɪst hɜː.
102915|18-000056|After this he said:|aftə ðɪs hiː sɛd:

102918|18-000059|You can if you will.|juː kan ɪf juː wɪl.

102920|18-000061|"Is it to give him up?" said Catherine.| "ɪz ɪt tuː ɡɪv hɪm ʌp?" sɛd kaθɹɪn.
102921|18-000062|Yes, it is to give him up.|jɛs, ɪt ɪz tuː ɡɪv hɪm ʌp.
102922|18-000063|And he held her still, with the same tenderness, looking into her face and resting his eyes on her averted eyes.|and hiː hɛld hɜː stɪl, wɪð ðə seɪm tɛndənəs, lʊkɪŋ ɪntʊ hɜː feɪs and ɹɛstɪŋ hɪz aɪz ɒn hɜː ɐvɜːtɪd aɪz.
102923|18-000064|There was a long silence;|ðeə wɒz eɪ lɒŋ saɪləns;
102924|18-000065|she wished he would release her.|ʃiː wɪʃt hiː wʊd ɹɪliːs hɜː.

102926|18-000067|I have no doubt you are unhappy just now.|aɪ hav nəʊ daʊt juː ɑː ʌnhapi dʒʌst naʊ.
102927|18-000068|But it is better to be unhappy for three months and get over it, than for many years and never get over it.|bʌt ɪt ɪz bɛtə tuː biː ʌnhapi fɔː θɹiː mʌnθs and ɡɛt əʊvə ɪt, ðɐn fɔː mɛni jiəz and nɛvə ɡɛt əʊvə ɪt.
102928|18-000069|"Yes, if that were so," said Catherine.| "jɛs, ɪf ðat wɜː səʊ," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
102929|18-000070|It would be so;|ɪt wʊd biː səʊ;
102930|18-000071|I am sure of that.|aɪ am ʃʊə ɒv ðat.
102931|18-000072|She answered nothing, and he went on.|ʃiː ansəd nʌθɪŋ, and hiː wɛnt ɒn.
102932|18-000073|Have you no faith in my wisdom, in my tenderness, in my solicitude for your future?|hav juː nəʊ feɪθ ɪn maɪ wɪzdəm, ɪn maɪ tɛndənəs, ɪn maɪ səlɪsɪtjuːd fɔː jɔː fjuːtʃə?

102934|18-000075|Don't you suppose that I know something of men: their vices, their follies, their falsities?|dəʊnt juː səpəʊz ðat aɪ nəʊ sʌmθɪŋ ɒv mɛn: ðeə vaɪsɪz, ðeə fɒliz, ðeə fɒlsɪtiz?
102935|18-000076|She detached herself, and turned upon him.|ʃiː dɪtatʃt hɜːsɛlf, and tɜːnd əpɒn hɪm.
102936|18-000077|He is not vicious -- he is not false!|hiː ɪz nɒt vɪʃəs -- hiː ɪz nɒt fɒls!
102937|18-000078|Her father kept looking at her with his sharp, pure eye.|hɜː fɑːðə kɛpt lʊkɪŋ at hɜː wɪð hɪz ʃɑːp, pjʊə aɪ.

102941|18-000082|Catherine was far from saying to herself that this was an ingenious sophism;|kaθɹɪn wɒz fɑː fɹɒm seɪɪŋ tuː hɜːsɛlf ðat ðɪs wɒz an ɪndʒiːniəs sɒfɪzəm;

102947|18-000088|it would be a great mistake.|ɪt wʊd biː eɪ ɡɹeɪt mɪsteɪk.

102951|18-000092|Will you forgive me?|wɪl juː fəɡɪv miː?
102952|18-000093|By no means.|baɪ nəʊ miːnz.
102953|18-000094|It will only be for once.|ɪt wɪl əʊnli biː fɔː wʌns.
102954|18-000095|I don't know what you mean by once.|aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ wɒt juː miːn baɪ wʌns.
102955|18-000096|You must either give him up or continue the acquaintance.|juː mʌst aɪðə ɡɪv hɪm ʌp ɔː kəntɪnjuː ðə ɐkweɪntəns.
102956|18-000097|I wish to explain -- to tell him to wait.|aɪ wɪʃ tuː ɛkspleɪn -- tuː tɛl hɪm tuː weɪt.
102957|18-000098|To wait for what?|tuː weɪt fɔː wɒt?
102958|18-000099|Till you know him better -- till you consent.|tɪl juː nəʊ hɪm bɛtə -- tɪl juː kənsɛnt.
102959|18-000100|Don't tell him any such nonsense as that.|dəʊnt tɛl hɪm ɛni sʌtʃ nɒnsəns az ðat.
102961|18-000102|"But we can wait a long time," said poor Catherine, in a tone which was meant to express the humblest conciliation, but which had upon her father's nerves the effect of an iteration not characterised by tact.| "bʌt wiː kan weɪt eɪ lɒŋ taɪm," sɛd pʊə kaθɹɪn, ɪn eɪ təʊn wɪtʃ wɒz mɛnt tuː ɛkspɹɛs ðə hʌmblɪst kənsɪlɪeɪʃən, bʌt wɪtʃ had əpɒn hɜː fɑːðəz nɜːvz ðə ɪfɛkt ɒv an ɪtəɹeɪʃən nɒt kaɹɪktəɹaɪzd baɪ takt.
102962|18-000103|The Doctor answered, however, quietly enough: "Of course you can wait till I die, if you like."|ðə dɒktə ansəd, haʊɛvə, kwaɪətli ɪnʌf: "ɒv kɔːs juː kan weɪt tɪl aɪ daɪ, ɪf juː laɪk."
102963|18-000104|Catherine gave a cry of natural horror.|kaθɹɪn ɡeɪv eɪ kɹaɪ ɒv natʃəɹəl hɒɹə.
102964|18-000105|Your engagement will have one delightful effect upon you;|jɔː ɛŋɡeɪdʒmənt wɪl hav wɒn dɪlaɪtfəl ɪfɛkt əpɒn juː;
102965|18-000106|it will make you extremely impatient for that event.|ɪt wɪl meɪk juː ɛkstɹiːmli ɪmpeɪʃənt fɔː ðat ɪvɛnt.
102966|18-000107|Catherine stood staring, and the Doctor enjoyed the point he had made.|kaθɹɪn stʊd steəɹɪŋ, and ðə dɒktə ɛndʒɔɪd ðə pɔɪnt hiː had meɪd.
102967|18-000108|It came to Catherine with the force -- or rather with the vague impressiveness -- of a logical axiom which it was not in her province to controvert;|ɪt keɪm tuː kaθɹɪn wɪð ðə fɔːs -- ɔː ɹɑːðə wɪð ðə veɪɡ ɪmpɹɛsɪvnəs -- ɒv eɪ lɒdʒɪkəl aksɪəm wɪtʃ ɪt wɒz nɒt ɪn hɜː pɹɒvɪns tuː kɒntɹəvɜːt;
102968|18-000109|and yet, though it was a scientific truth, she felt wholly unable to accept it.|and jɛt, ðəʊ ɪt wɒz eɪ saɪəntɪfɪk tɹuːθ, ʃiː fɛlt həʊli ʌneɪbəl tuː ɐksɛpt ɪt.
102969|18-000110|"I would rather not marry, if that were true," she said.| "aɪ wʊd ɹɑːðə nɒt maɹi, ɪf ðat wɜː tɹuː," ʃiː sɛd.
102970|18-000111|Give me a proof of it, then;|ɡɪv miː eɪ pɹuːf ɒv ɪt, ðɛn;
102971|18-000112|for it is beyond a question that by engaging yourself to Morris Townsend you simply wait for my death.|fɔː ɪt ɪz bɪjɒnd eɪ kwɛstʃən ðat baɪ ɛŋɡeɪdʒɪŋ jɔːsɛlf tuː mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd juː sɪmpli weɪt fɔː maɪ dɛθ.
102972|18-000113|She turned away, feeling sick and faint;|ʃiː tɜːnd ɐweɪ, fiːlɪŋ sɪk and feɪnt;
102973|18-000114|and the Doctor went on.|and ðə dɒktə wɛnt ɒn.
102974|18-000115|And if you wait for it with impatience, judge, if you please, what his eagerness will be!|and ɪf juː weɪt fɔː ɪt wɪð ɪmpeɪʃəns, dʒʌdʒ, ɪf juː pliːz, wɒt hɪz iːɡənəs wɪl biː!
102975|18-000116|Catherine turned it over -- her father's words had such an authority for her that her very thoughts were capable of obeying him.|kaθɹɪn tɜːnd ɪt əʊvə -- hɜː fɑːðəz wɜːdz had sʌtʃ an ɐθɒɹɪti fɔː hɜː ðat hɜː vɛɹi θɔːts wɜː keɪpəbəl ɒv əʊbeɪɪŋ hɪm.
102976|18-000117|There was a dreadful ugliness in it, which seemed to glare at her through the interposing medium of her own feebler reason.|ðeə wɒz eɪ dɹɛdfəl ʌɡlinəs ɪn ɪt, wɪtʃ siːmd tuː ɡleə at hɜː θɹuː ðə ɪntəpəʊzɪŋ miːdiəm ɒv hɜː əʊn fiːblə ɹiːzən.
102977|18-000118|Suddenly, however, she had an inspiration -- she almost knew it to be an inspiration.|sʌdənli, haʊɛvə, ʃiː had an ɪnspəɹeɪʃən -- ʃiː ɔːlməʊst njuː ɪt tuː biː an ɪnspəɹeɪʃən.
102978|18-000119|"If I don't marry before your death, I will not after," she said.| "ɪf aɪ dəʊnt maɹi bɪfɔː jɔː dɛθ, aɪ wɪl nɒt aftə," ʃiː sɛd.
102979|18-000120|To her father, it must be admitted, this seemed only another epigram;|tuː hɜː fɑːðə, ɪt mʌst biː ɐdmɪtɪd, ðɪs siːmd əʊnli ɐnʌðə ɛpɪɡɹam;
102980|18-000121|and as obstinacy, in unaccomplished minds, does not usually select such a mode of expression, he was the more surprised at this wanton play of a fixed idea.|and az ɒbstɪnəsi, ɪn ʌnɐkɒmplɪʃt maɪndz, dʌz nɒt juːʒuːəli sɪlɛkt sʌtʃ eɪ məʊd ɒv ɛkspɹɛʃən, hiː wɒz ðə mɔː səpɹaɪzd at ðɪs wɒntən pleɪ ɒv eɪ fɪkst aɪdiə.
102981|18-000122|"Do you mean that for an impertinence?" he inquired;| "duː juː miːn ðat fɔː an ɪmpɜːtɪnəns?" hiː ɪŋkwaɪəd;
102982|18-000123|an inquiry of which, as he made it, he quite perceived the grossness.|an ɪŋkwaɪəɹi ɒv wɪtʃ, az hiː meɪd ɪt, hiː kwaɪt pəsiːvd ðə ɡɹəʊsnəs.
102983|18-000124|An impertinence?|an ɪmpɜːtɪnəns?
102984|18-000125|Oh, father, what terrible things you say!|əʊ, fɑːðə, wɒt tɛɹɪbəl θɪŋz juː seɪ!
102985|18-000126|If you don't wait for my death, you might as well marry immediately;|ɪf juː dəʊnt weɪt fɔː maɪ dɛθ, juː maɪt az wɛl maɹi ɪmiːdɪətli;
102986|18-000127|there is nothing else to wait for.|ðeə ɪz nʌθɪŋ ɛls tuː weɪt fɔː.
102987|18-000128|For some time Catherine made no answer;|fɔː sʌm taɪm kaθɹɪn meɪd nəʊ ansə;
102988|18-000129|but finally she said:|bʌt faɪnəli ʃiː sɛd:
102989|18-000130|I think Morris -- little by little -- might persuade you.|aɪ θɪŋk mɒɹɪs -- lɪtəl baɪ lɪtəl -- maɪt pəsweɪd juː.
102990|18-000131|I shall never let him speak to me again.|aɪ ʃal nɛvə lɛt hɪm spiːk tuː miː ɐɡɛn.
102991|18-000132|I dislike him too much.|aɪ dɪslaɪk hɪm tuː mʌtʃ.
102993|18-000134|she tried to stifle it, for she had made up her mind that it was wrong to make a parade of her trouble, and to endeavour to act upon her father by the meretricious aid of emotion.|ʃiː tɹaɪd tuː staɪfəl ɪt, fɔː ʃiː had meɪd ʌp hɜː maɪnd ðat ɪt wɒz ɹɒŋ tuː meɪk eɪ pəɹeɪd ɒv hɜː tɹʌbəl, and tuː ɛndɛvə tuː akt əpɒn hɜː fɑːðə baɪ ðə mɛɹɪtɹɪʃəs eɪd ɒv ɪməʊʃən.
102994|18-000135|Indeed, she even thought it wrong -- in the sense of being inconsiderate -- to attempt to act upon his feelings at all;|ɪndiːd, ʃiː iːvən θɔːt ɪt ɹɒŋ -- ɪn ðə sɛns ɒv biːɪŋ ɪŋkənsɪdəɹət -- tuː ɐtɛmpt tuː akt əpɒn hɪz fiːlɪŋz at ɔːl;
102995|18-000136|her part was to effect some gentle, gradual change in his intellectual perception of poor Morris's character.|hɜː pɑːt wɒz tuː ɪfɛkt sʌm dʒɛntəl, ɡɹadʒuːəl tʃeɪndʒ ɪn hɪz ɪntəlɛktʃuːəl pəsɛpʃən ɒv pʊə mɒɹɪs kaɹɪktə.
102996|18-000137|But the means of effecting such a change were at present shrouded in mystery, and she felt miserably helpless and hopeless.|bʌt ðə miːnz ɒv ɪfɛktɪŋ sʌtʃ eɪ tʃeɪndʒ wɜː at pɹɛzənt ʃɹaʊdɪd ɪn mɪstəɹi, and ʃiː fɛlt mɪzɹəbli hɛlpləs and həʊpləs.
102997|18-000138|She had exhausted all arguments, all replies.|ʃiː had ɛɡzɔːstɪd ɔːl ɑːɡjuːmənts, ɔːl ɹɪplaɪz.
102998|18-000139|Her father might have pitied her, and in fact he did so;|hɜː fɑːðə maɪt hav pɪtid hɜː, and ɪn fakt hiː dɪd səʊ;
102999|18-000140|but he was sure he was right.|bʌt hiː wɒz ʃʊə hiː wɒz ɹaɪt.
103001|18-000142|That will interest him more than anything else you can tell him.|ðat wɪl ɪntɹɪst hɪm mɔː ðɐn ɛnɪθɪŋ ɛls juː kan tɛl hɪm.
103002|18-000143|"That would be very right," Catherine answered.| "ðat wʊd biː vɛɹi ɹaɪt," kaθɹɪn ansəd.
103003|18-000144|I ought not in that case to have a farthing of your money.|aɪ ɔːt nɒt ɪn ðat keɪs tuː hav eɪ fɑːθɪŋ ɒv jɔː mʌni.
103004|18-000145|"My dear child," the Doctor observed, laughing, "your simplicity is touching."| "maɪ diə tʃaɪld," ðə dɒktə ɒbzɜːvd, lafɪŋ, "jɔː sɪmplɪsɪti ɪz tʌtʃɪŋ."
103005|18-000146|Make that remark, in that tone, and with that expression of countenance, to mister Townsend, and take a note of his answer.|meɪk ðat ɹɪmɑːk, ɪn ðat təʊn, and wɪð ðat ɛkspɹɛʃən ɒv kaʊntənəns, tuː mɪstə taʊnsɛnd, and teɪk eɪ nəʊt ɒv hɪz ansə.
103006|18-000147|It won't be polite -- it will, express irritation;|ɪt wɒnt biː pəlaɪt -- ɪt wɪl, ɛkspɹɛs ɪɹɪteɪʃən;
103007|18-000148|and I shall be glad of that, as it will put me in the right;|and aɪ ʃal biː ɡlad ɒv ðat, az ɪt wɪl pʊt miː ɪn ðə ɹaɪt;
103008|18-000149|unless, indeed -- which is perfectly possible -- you should like him the better for being rude to you.|ʌnlɛs, ɪndiːd -- wɪtʃ ɪz pɜːfɛktlɪ pɒsɪbəl -- juː ʃʊd laɪk hɪm ðə bɛtə fɔː biːɪŋ ɹuːd tuː juː.
103009|18-000150|"He will never be rude to me," said Catherine gently.| "hiː wɪl nɛvə biː ɹuːd tuː miː," sɛd kaθɹɪn dʒɛntli.
103010|18-000151|Tell him what I say, all the same.|tɛl hɪm wɒt aɪ seɪ, ɔːl ðə seɪm.
103011|18-000152|She looked at her father, and her quiet eyes filled with tears.|ʃiː lʊkt at hɜː fɑːðə, and hɜː kwaɪət aɪz fɪld wɪð tiəz.
103012|18-000153|"I think I will see him, then," she murmured, in her timid voice.| "aɪ θɪŋk aɪ wɪl siː hɪm, ðɛn," ʃiː mɜːməd, ɪn hɜː tɪmɪd vɔɪs.
103013|18-000154|Exactly as you choose!|ɛɡzaktli az juː tʃuːz!
103014|18-000155|And he went to the door and opened it for her to go out.|and hiː wɛnt tuː ðə dɔː and əʊpənd ɪt fɔː hɜː tuː ɡəʊ aʊt.
103015|18-000156|The movement gave her a terrible sense of his turning her off.|ðə muːvmənt ɡeɪv hɜː eɪ tɛɹɪbəl sɛns ɒv hɪz tɜːnɪŋ hɜː ɒf.
103016|18-000157|"It will be only once, for the present," she added, lingering a moment.| "ɪt wɪl biː əʊnli wʌns, fɔː ðə pɹɛzənt," ʃiː adɪd, lɪŋɡəɹɪŋ eɪ məʊmənt.
103017|18-000158|"Exactly as you choose," he repeated, standing there with his hand on the door.| "ɛɡzaktli az juː tʃuːz," hiː ɹɪpiːtɪd, standɪŋ ðeə wɪð hɪz hand ɒn ðə dɔː.
103018|18-000159|I have told you what I think.|aɪ hav təʊld juː wɒt aɪ θɪŋk.
103019|18-000160|If you see him, you will be an ungrateful, cruel child;|ɪf juː siː hɪm, juː wɪl biː an ʌŋɡɹeɪtfəl, kɹuːəl tʃaɪld;

103021|18-000162|This was more than the poor girl could bear;|ðɪs wɒz mɔː ðɐn ðə pʊə ɡɜːl kʊd beə;
103022|18-000163|her tears overflowed, and she moved towards her grimly consistent parent with a pitiful cry.|hɜː tiəz əʊvəfləʊd, and ʃiː muːvd təwɔːdz hɜː ɡɹɪmli kənsɪstənt peəɹənt wɪð eɪ pɪtifəl kɹaɪ.
103023|18-000164|Her hands were raised in supplication, but he sternly evaded this appeal.|hɜː handz wɜː ɹeɪzd ɪn sʌplɪkeɪʃən, bʌt hiː stɜːnli ɪveɪdɪd ðɪs ɐpiːl.
103024|18-000165|Instead of letting her sob out her misery on his shoulder, he simply took her by the arm and directed her course across the threshold, closing the door gently but firmly behind her.|ɪnstɛd ɒv lɛtɪŋ hɜː sɒb aʊt hɜː mɪzəɹi ɒn hɪz ʃəʊldə, hiː sɪmpli tʊk hɜː baɪ ðə ɑːm and daɪɹɛktɪd hɜː kɔːs əkɹɒs ðə θɹɛʃəʊld, kləʊzɪŋ ðə dɔː dʒɛntli bʌt fɜːmli bɪhaɪnd hɜː.
103025|18-000166|After he had done so, he remained listening.|aftə hiː had dʌn səʊ, hiː ɹɪmeɪnd lɪsənɪŋ.
103026|18-000167|For a long time there was no sound;|fɔː eɪ lɒŋ taɪm ðeə wɒz nəʊ saʊnd;
103027|18-000168|he knew that she was standing outside.|hiː njuː ðat ʃiː wɒz standɪŋ aʊtsaɪd.
103028|18-000169|He was sorry for her, as I have said;|hiː wɒz sɒɹi fɔː hɜː, az aɪ hav sɛd;
103029|18-000170|but he was so sure he was right.|bʌt hiː wɒz səʊ ʃʊə hiː wɒz ɹaɪt.
103030|18-000171|At last he heard her move away, and then her footstep creaked faintly upon the stairs.|at last hiː hɜːd hɜː muːv ɐweɪ, and ðɛn hɜː fʊtstɛp kɹiːkt feɪntli əpɒn ðə steəz.
103031|18-000172|The Doctor took several turns round his study, with his hands in his pockets, and a thin sparkle, possibly of irritation, but partly also of something like humour, in his eye.|ðə dɒktə tʊk sɛvɹəl tɜːnz ɹaʊnd hɪz stʌdi, wɪð hɪz handz ɪn hɪz pɒkɪts, and eɪ θɪn spɑːkəl, pɒsɪbli ɒv ɪɹɪteɪʃən, bʌt pɑːtli ɔːlsəʊ ɒv sʌmθɪŋ laɪk hjuːmə, ɪn hɪz aɪ.
103033|18-000174|And this idea of Catherine "sticking" appeared to have a comical side, and to offer a prospect of entertainment.|and ðɪs aɪdiə ɒv kaθɹɪn "stɪkɪŋ" ɐpiəd tuː hav eɪ kɒmɪkəl saɪd, and tuː ɒfə eɪ pɹɒspɛkt ɒv ɛntəteɪnmənt.
103034|19-000001|it was for reasons connected with this determination that on the morrow he sought a few words of private conversation with misess Penniman.|ɪt wɒz fɔː ɹiːzənz kənɛktɪd wɪð ðɪs dɪtɜːmɪneɪʃən ðat ɒn ðə mɒɹəʊ hiː sɔːt eɪ fjuː wɜːdz ɒv pɹaɪvət kɒnvəseɪʃən wɪð mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
103035|19-000002|He sent for her to the library, and he there informed her that he hoped very much that, as regarded this affair of Catherine's, she would mind her p's and q's.|hiː sɛnt fɔː hɜː tuː ðə laɪbɹəɹi, and hiː ðeə ɪnfɔːmd hɜː ðat hiː həʊpt vɛɹi mʌtʃ ðat, az ɹɪɡɑːdɪd ðɪs ɐfeə ɒv kaθɹɪnz, ʃiː wʊd maɪnd hɜː piːɛs and kjuːɛs.
103036|19-000003|"I don't know what you mean by such an expression," said his sister.| "aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ wɒt juː miːn baɪ sʌtʃ an ɛkspɹɛʃən," sɛd hɪz sɪstə.
103037|19-000004|You speak as if I were learning the alphabet.|juː spiːk az ɪf aɪ wɜː lɜːnɪŋ ðə alfəbɛt.
103038|19-000005|"The alphabet of common sense is something you will never learn," the Doctor permitted himself to respond.| "ðə alfəbɛt ɒv kɒmən sɛns ɪz sʌmθɪŋ juː wɪl nɛvə lɜːn," ðə dɒktə pəmɪtɪd hɪmsɛlf tuː ɹɪspɒnd.

103047|19-000014|she understands them perfectly, and anything that she does further in the way of encouraging mister Townsend's attentions will be in deliberate opposition to my wishes.|ʃiː ʌndəstandz ðɛm pɜːfɛktlɪ, and ɛnɪθɪŋ ðat ʃiː dʌz fɜːðə ɪn ðə weɪ ɒv ɛŋkʌɹɪdʒɪŋ mɪstə taʊnsɛndz ɐtɛnʃənz wɪl biː ɪn dɪlɪbəɹət ɒpəzɪʃən tuː maɪ wɪʃɪz.

103061|19-000028|It is highly probable you have been corresponding with him for the last three weeks -- perhaps even seeing him.|ɪt ɪz haɪli pɹɒbəbəl juː hav biːn kɒɹɪspɒndɪŋ wɪð hɪm fɔː ðə last θɹiː wiːks -- pəhaps iːvən siːɪŋ hɪm.
103062|19-000029|I don't ask you -- you needn't tell me.|aɪ dəʊnt ask juː -- juː niːdnt tɛl miː.
103064|19-000031|Whatever you have done, stop doing it.|wɒtɛvə juː hav dʌn, stɒp duːɪŋ ɪt.
103065|19-000032|That's all I wish.|ðats ɔːl aɪ wɪʃ.
103066|19-000033|"Don't you wish also by chance to murder our child?" misess Penniman inquired.| "dəʊnt juː wɪʃ ɔːlsəʊ baɪ tʃans tuː mɜːdə aʊə tʃaɪld?" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɪŋkwaɪəd.
103067|19-000034|On the contrary, I wish to make her live and be happy.|ɒn ðə kɒntɹəɹi, aɪ wɪʃ tuː meɪk hɜː laɪv and biː hapi.
103068|19-000035|You will kill her;|juː wɪl kɪl hɜː;
103069|19-000036|she passed a dreadful night.|ʃiː past eɪ dɹɛdfəl naɪt.
103070|19-000037|She won't die of one dreadful night, nor of a dozen.|ʃiː wɒnt daɪ ɒv wɒn dɹɛdfəl naɪt, nɔː ɒv eɪ dʌzən.
103071|19-000038|Remember that I am a distinguished physician.|ɹɪmɛmbə ðat aɪ am eɪ dɪstɪŋɡwɪʃt fɪzɪʃən.
103072|19-000039|misess Penniman hesitated a moment.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən hɛzɪteɪtɪd eɪ məʊmənt.
103073|19-000040|Then she risked her retort.|ðɛn ʃiː ɹɪskt hɜː ɹɪtɔːt.
103074|19-000041|Your being a distinguished physician has not prevented you from already losing two members of your family!|jɔː biːɪŋ eɪ dɪstɪŋɡwɪʃt fɪzɪʃən haz nɒt pɹɪvɛntɪd juː fɹɒm ɔːlɹɛdi luːzɪŋ tuː mɛmbəz ɒv jɔː famɪli!
103075|19-000042|She had risked it, but her brother gave her such a terribly incisive look -- a look so like a surgeon's lancet -- that she was frightened at her courage.|ʃiː had ɹɪskt ɪt, bʌt hɜː bɹʌðə ɡeɪv hɜː sʌtʃ eɪ tɛɹɪbli ɪnsaɪsɪv lʊk -- eɪ lʊk səʊ laɪk eɪ sɜːdʒənz lansɪt -- ðat ʃiː wɒz fɹaɪtənd at hɜː kʌɹɪdʒ.
103076|19-000043|And he answered her in words that corresponded to the look: "It may not prevent me, either, from losing the society of still another."|and hiː ansəd hɜː ɪn wɜːdz ðat kɒɹɪspɒndɪd tuː ðə lʊk: "ɪt meɪ nɒt pɹɪvɛnt miː, aɪðə, fɹɒm luːzɪŋ ðə səsaɪəti ɒv stɪl ɐnʌðə."
103077|19-000044|misess Penniman took herself off, with whatever air of depreciated merit was at her command, and repaired to Catherine's room, where the poor girl was closeted.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən tʊk hɜːsɛlf ɒf, wɪð wɒtɛvə eə ɒv dɪpɹiːʃɪeɪtɪd mɛɹɪt wɒz at hɜː kəmand, and ɹɪpeəd tuː kaθɹɪnz ɹuːm, weə ðə pʊə ɡɜːl wɒz klɒzɪtɪd.
103078|19-000045|She knew all about her dreadful night, for the two had met again, the evening before, after Catherine left her father.|ʃiː njuː ɔːl ɐbaʊt hɜː dɹɛdfəl naɪt, fɔː ðə tuː had mɛt ɐɡɛn, ðə iːvnɪŋ bɪfɔː, aftə kaθɹɪn lɛft hɜː fɑːðə.
103081|19-000048|It was still less remarkable that she should have felt an extreme curiosity to learn the result of this interview, and that this sentiment, combined with her great amiability and generosity, should have prompted her to regret the sharp words lately exchanged between her niece and herself.|ɪt wɒz stɪl lɛs ɹɪmɑːkəbəl ðat ʃiː ʃʊd hav fɛlt an ɛkstɹiːm kjʊəɹɪɒsɪti tuː lɜːn ðə ɹɪzʌlt ɒv ðɪs ɪntəvjuː, and ðat ðɪs sɛntɪmənt, kəmbaɪnd wɪð hɜː ɡɹeɪt eɪmiəbɪlɪti and dʒɛnəɹɒsɪti, ʃʊd hav pɹɒmptɪd hɜː tuː ɹɪɡɹɛt ðə ʃɑːp wɜːdz leɪtli ɛkstʃeɪndʒd bɪtwiːn hɜː niːs and hɜːsɛlf.
103082|19-000049|As the unhappy girl came into sight, in the dusky corridor, she made a lively demonstration of sympathy.|az ðə ʌnhapi ɡɜːl keɪm ɪntʊ saɪt, ɪn ðə dʌski kɒɹɪdɔː, ʃiː meɪd eɪ laɪvlɪ dɛmənstɹeɪʃən ɒv sɪmpəθi.
103083|19-000050|Catherine's bursting heart was equally oblivious.|kaθɹɪnz bɜːstɪŋ hɑːt wɒz iːkwəli əblɪviəs.
103084|19-000051|She only knew that her aunt was taking her into her arms.|ʃiː əʊnli njuː ðat hɜː ant wɒz teɪkɪŋ hɜː ɪntʊ hɜː ɑːmz.
103085|19-000052|misess Penniman drew her into Catherine's own room, and the two women sat there together, far into the small hours;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən dɹuː hɜː ɪntʊ kaθɹɪnz əʊn ɹuːm, and ðə tuː wɪmɪn sat ðeə təɡɛðə, fɑː ɪntʊ ðə smɔːl aʊəz;
103086|19-000053|the younger one with her head on the other's lap, sobbing and sobbing at first in a soundless, stifled manner, and then at last perfectly still.|ðə jʌŋɡə wɒn wɪð hɜː hɛd ɒn ðə ʌðəz lap, sɒbɪŋ and sɒbɪŋ at fɜːst ɪn eɪ saʊndləs, staɪfəld manə, and ðɛn at last pɜːfɛktlɪ stɪl.
103087|19-000054|It gratified misess Penniman to be able to feel conscientiously that this scene virtually removed the interdict which Catherine had placed upon her further communion with Morris Townsend.|ɪt ɡɹatɪfaɪd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən tuː biː eɪbəl tuː fiːl kɒnsɪɛnʃəsli ðat ðɪs siːn vɜːtʃuːəli ɹɪmuːvd ðə ɪntədɪkt wɪtʃ kaθɹɪn had pleɪst əpɒn hɜː fɜːðə kəmjuːniən wɪð mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
103089|19-000056|"You should not go to breakfast," she said;| "juː ʃʊd nɒt ɡəʊ tuː bɹɛkfəst," ʃiː sɛd;
103090|19-000057|you are not well enough, after your fearful night.|juː ɑː nɒt wɛl ɪnʌf, aftə jɔː fiəfəl naɪt.
103091|19-000058|Yes, I am very well, and I am only afraid of being late.|jɛs, aɪ am vɛɹi wɛl, and aɪ am əʊnli ɐfɹeɪd ɒv biːɪŋ leɪt.
103092|19-000059|"I can't understand you!" misess Penniman cried.| "aɪ kant ʌndəstand juː!" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən kɹaɪd.
103093|19-000060|You should stay in bed for three days.|juː ʃʊd steɪ ɪn bɛd fɔː θɹiː deɪz.
103094|19-000061|"Oh, I could never do that!" said Catherine, to whom this idea presented no attractions.| "əʊ, aɪ kʊd nɛvə duː ðat!" sɛd kaθɹɪn, tuː huːm ðɪs aɪdiə pɹɪzɛntɪd nəʊ ɐtɹakʃənz.
103096|19-000063|She had a most impracticable physique.|ʃiː had eɪ məʊst ɪmpɹaktɪkəbəl fɪziːk.
103098|19-000065|"He would not like me to lie in bed," said Catherine simply.| "hiː wʊd nɒt laɪk miː tuː laɪ ɪn bɛd," sɛd kaθɹɪn sɪmpli.
103099|19-000066|All the more reason for your doing it.|ɔːl ðə mɔː ɹiːzən fɔː jɔː duːɪŋ ɪt.
103100|19-000067|How else do you expect to move him?|haʊ ɛls duː juː ɛkspɛkt tuː muːv hɪm?
103101|19-000068|Catherine thought a little.|kaθɹɪn θɔːt eɪ lɪtəl.
103102|19-000069|I don't know how;|aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ haʊ;
103103|19-000070|but not in that way.|bʌt nɒt ɪn ðat weɪ.
103104|19-000071|I wish to be just as usual.|aɪ wɪʃ tuː biː dʒʌst az juːʒuːəl.
103105|19-000072|And she finished dressing, and, according to her aunt's expression, went plumping down into the paternal presence.|and ʃiː fɪnɪʃt dɹɛsɪŋ, and, ɐkɔːdɪŋ tuː hɜː ants ɛkspɹɛʃən, wɛnt plʌmpɪŋ daʊn ɪntʊ ðə pətɜːnəl pɹɛzəns.
103106|19-000073|She was really too modest for consistent pathos.|ʃiː wɒz ɹiəlɪ tuː mɒdɪst fɔː kənsɪstənt peɪθɒs.
103107|19-000074|And yet it was perfectly true that she had had a dreadful night.|and jɛt ɪt wɒz pɜːfɛktlɪ tɹuː ðat ʃiː had had eɪ dɹɛdfəl naɪt.
103108|19-000075|Even after misess Penniman left her she had had no sleep.|iːvən aftə mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən lɛft hɜː ʃiː had had nəʊ sliːp.
103110|19-000077|Her heart was breaking.|hɜː hɑːt wɒz bɹeɪkɪŋ.
103111|19-000078|She had heart enough for that.|ʃiː had hɑːt ɪnʌf fɔː ðat.
103112|19-000079|At moments it seemed to her that she believed him, and that to do what she was doing, a girl must indeed be bad.|at məʊmənts ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː ðat ʃiː bɪliːvd hɪm, and ðat tuː duː wɒt ʃiː wɒz duːɪŋ, eɪ ɡɜːl mʌst ɪndiːd biː bad.
103113|19-000080|She was bad;|ʃiː wɒz bad;
103114|19-000081|but she couldn't help it.|bʌt ʃiː kʊdnt hɛlp ɪt.
103115|19-000082|She would try to appear good, even if her heart were perverted;|ʃiː wʊd tɹaɪ tuː ɐpiə ɡʊd, iːvən ɪf hɜː hɑːt wɜː pəvɜːtɪd;
103116|19-000083|and from time to time she had a fancy that she might accomplish something by ingenious concessions to form, though she should persist in caring for Morris.|and fɹɒm taɪm tuː taɪm ʃiː had eɪ fansi ðat ʃiː maɪt ɐkɒmplɪʃ sʌmθɪŋ baɪ ɪndʒiːniəs kənsɛʃənz tuː fɔːm, ðəʊ ʃiː ʃʊd pəsɪst ɪn keəɹɪŋ fɔː mɒɹɪs.
103117|19-000084|Catherine's ingenuities were indefinite, and we are not called upon to expose their hollowness.|kaθɹɪnz ɪndʒɪnjuːɪtiz wɜː ɪndɛfɪnət, and wiː ɑː nɒt kɔːld əpɒn tuː ɛkspəʊz ðeə hɒləʊnəs.
103119|19-000086|Poor Catherine was conscious of her freshness;|pʊə kaθɹɪn wɒz kɒnʃəs ɒv hɜː fɹɛʃnəs;
103120|19-000087|it gave her a feeling about the future which rather added to the weight upon her mind.|ɪt ɡeɪv hɜː eɪ fiːlɪŋ ɐbaʊt ðə fjuːtʃə wɪtʃ ɹɑːðə adɪd tuː ðə weɪt əpɒn hɜː maɪnd.
103121|19-000088|It seemed a proof that she was strong and solid and dense, and would live to a great age -- longer than might be generally convenient;|ɪt siːmd eɪ pɹuːf ðat ʃiː wɒz stɹɒŋ and sɒlɪd and dɛns, and wʊd laɪv tuː eɪ ɡɹeɪt eɪdʒ -- lɒŋɡə ðɐn maɪt biː dʒɛnəɹəli kənviːnɪənt;
103122|19-000089|and this idea was depressing, for it appeared to saddle her with a pretension the more, just when the cultivation of any pretension was inconsistent with her doing right.|and ðɪs aɪdiə wɒz dɪpɹɛsɪŋ, fɔː ɪt ɐpiəd tuː sadəl hɜː wɪð eɪ pɹɪtɛnʃən ðə mɔː, dʒʌst wɛn ðə kʌltɪveɪʃən ɒv ɛni pɹɪtɛnʃən wɒz ɪŋkənsɪstənt wɪð hɜː duːɪŋ ɹaɪt.
103123|19-000090|She wrote that day to Morris Townsend, requesting him to come and see her on the morrow;|ʃiː ɹəʊt ðat deɪ tuː mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd, ɹɪkwɛstɪŋ hɪm tuː kʌm and siː hɜː ɒn ðə mɒɹəʊ;
103124|19-000091|using very few words, and explaining nothing.|juːzɪŋ vɛɹi fjuː wɜːdz, and ɛkspleɪnɪŋ nʌθɪŋ.
103126|20-000002|She received him in the big, bright front parlour, and she instructed the servant that if any one should call she was particularly engaged.|ʃiː ɹɪsiːvd hɪm ɪn ðə bɪɡ, bɹaɪt fɹʌnt pɑːlə, and ʃiː ɪnstɹʌktɪd ðə sɜːvənt ðat ɪf ɛni wɒn ʃʊd kɔːl ʃiː wɒz pətɪkjʊləli ɛŋɡeɪdʒd.
103127|20-000003|She was not afraid of her father's coming in, for at that hour he was always driving about town.|ʃiː wɒz nɒt ɐfɹeɪd ɒv hɜː fɑːðəz kʌmɪŋ ɪn, fɔː at ðat aʊə hiː wɒz ɔːlweɪz dɹaɪvɪŋ ɐbaʊt taʊn.
103129|20-000005|the next was that he had pressed her in his arms.|ðə nɛkst wɒz ðat hiː had pɹɛst hɜː ɪn hɪz ɑːmz.
103130|20-000006|When she was free again it appeared to her that she had now indeed thrown herself into the gulf of defiance, and even, for an instant, that she had been married to him.|wɛn ʃiː wɒz fɹiː ɐɡɛn ɪt ɐpiəd tuː hɜː ðat ʃiː had naʊ ɪndiːd θɹəʊn hɜːsɛlf ɪntʊ ðə ɡʌlf ɒv dɪfaɪəns, and iːvən, fɔː an ɪnstənt, ðat ʃiː had biːn maɹid tuː hɪm.
103131|20-000007|He told her that she had been very cruel, and had made him very unhappy;|hiː təʊld hɜː ðat ʃiː had biːn vɛɹi kɹuːəl, and had meɪd hɪm vɛɹi ʌnhapi;
103132|20-000008|and Catherine felt acutely the difficulty of her destiny, which forced her to give pain in such opposite quarters.|and kaθɹɪn fɛlt ɐkjuːtli ðə dɪfɪkʌlti ɒv hɜː dɛstɪni, wɪtʃ fɔːst hɜː tuː ɡɪv peɪn ɪn sʌtʃ ɒpəzɪt kwɔːtəz.
103133|20-000009|But she wished that, instead of reproaches, however tender, he would give her help;|bʌt ʃiː wɪʃt ðat, ɪnstɛd ɒv ɹɪpɹəʊtʃɪz, haʊɛvə tɛndə, hiː wʊd ɡɪv hɜː hɛlp;
103134|20-000010|he was certainly wise enough, and clever enough, to invent some issue from their troubles.|hiː wɒz sɜːtənli waɪz ɪnʌf, and klɛvə ɪnʌf, tuː ɪnvɛnt sʌm ɪʃuː fɹɒm ðeə tɹʌbəlz.
103135|20-000011|She expressed this belief, and Morris received the assurance as if he thought it natural;|ʃiː ɛkspɹɛst ðɪs bɪliːf, and mɒɹɪs ɹɪsiːvd ðə əʃʊəɹəns az ɪf hiː θɔːt ɪt natʃəɹəl;
103136|20-000012|but he interrogated, at first -- as was natural too -- rather than committed himself to marking out a course.|bʌt hiː ɪntɛɹəɡeɪtɪd, at fɜːst -- az wɒz natʃəɹəl tuː -- ɹɑːðə ðɐn kəmɪtɪd hɪmsɛlf tuː mɑːkɪŋ aʊt eɪ kɔːs.

103142|20-000018|Decided whether you would keep me or give me up.|dɪsaɪdɪd wɛðə juː wʊd kiːp miː ɔː ɡɪv miː ʌp.
103143|20-000019|"Oh, Morris," she cried, with a long tender murmur, "I never thought of giving you up!"| "əʊ, mɒɹɪs," ʃiː kɹaɪd, wɪð eɪ lɒŋ tɛndə mɜːmə, "aɪ nɛvə θɔːt ɒv ɡɪvɪŋ juː ʌp!"
103144|20-000020|What, then, were you waiting for?|wɒt, ðɛn, wɜː juː weɪtɪŋ fɔː?
103145|20-000021|The young man was ardently logical.|ðə jʌŋ man wɒz ɑːdəntli lɒdʒɪkəl.

103151|20-000027|Is that it?|ɪz ðat ɪt?
103152|20-000028|This hypothetical optimism gave the poor girl a pang.|ðɪs haɪpəθɛtɪkəl ɒptɪmɪzəm ɡeɪv ðə pʊə ɡɜːl eɪ paŋ.
103153|20-000029|"No, Morris," she said solemnly, "he looks at it still in the same way."| "nəʊ, mɒɹɪs," ʃiː sɛd sɒləmli, "hiː lʊks at ɪt stɪl ɪn ðə seɪm weɪ."
103154|20-000030|Then why have you sent for me?|ðɛn waɪ hav juː sɛnt fɔː miː?
103155|20-000031|"Because I wanted to see you!" cried Catherine piteously.| "bɪkɒz aɪ wɒntɪd tuː siː juː!" kɹaɪd kaθɹɪn pɪtiəsli.
103156|20-000032|That's an excellent reason, surely.|ðats an ɛksələnt ɹiːzən, ʃʊəli.
103157|20-000033|But did you want to look at me only?|bʌt dɪd juː wɒnt tuː lʊk at miː əʊnli?
103158|20-000034|Have you nothing to tell me?|hav juː nʌθɪŋ tuː tɛl miː?
103159|20-000035|His beautiful persuasive eyes were fixed upon her face, and she wondered what answer would be noble enough to make to such a gaze as that.|hɪz bjuːtifəl pəsweɪsɪv aɪz wɜː fɪkst əpɒn hɜː feɪs, and ʃiː wʌndəd wɒt ansə wʊd biː nəʊbəl ɪnʌf tuː meɪk tuː sʌtʃ eɪ ɡeɪz az ðat.
103160|20-000036|For a moment her own eyes took it in, and then -- "I did want to look at you!" she said gently.|fɔː eɪ məʊmənt hɜː əʊn aɪz tʊk ɪt ɪn, and ðɛn -- "aɪ dɪd wɒnt tuː lʊk at juː!" ʃiː sɛd dʒɛntli.

103162|20-000038|Morris watched her for a moment, attentively.|mɒɹɪs wɒtʃt hɜː fɔː eɪ məʊmənt, ɐtɛntɪvli.

103169|20-000045|She hardly knew for what;|ʃiː hɑːdli njuː fɔː wɒt;

103172|20-000048|He shook his head, sadly and reproachfully.|hiː ʃʊk hɪz hɛd, sadli and ɹɪpɹəʊtʃfəli.
103174|20-000050|Do you want to turn it over in your mind for five years?|duː juː wɒnt tuː tɜːn ɪt əʊvə ɪn jɔː maɪnd fɔː faɪv jiəz?

103176|20-000052|"My poor girl," he added in a moment, "you are not sincere!"| "maɪ pʊə ɡɜːl," hiː adɪd ɪn eɪ məʊmənt, "juː ɑː nɒt sɪnsiə!"
103177|20-000053|Catherine coloured from brow to chin, and her eyes filled with tears.|kaθɹɪn kʌləd fɹɒm bɹaʊ tuː tʃɪn, and hɜː aɪz fɪld wɪð tiəz.
103178|20-000054|"Oh, how can you say that?" she murmured.| "əʊ, haʊ kan juː seɪ ðat?" ʃiː mɜːməd.
103179|20-000055|"Why, you must take me or leave me," said Morris, very reasonably.| "waɪ, juː mʌst teɪk miː ɔː liːv miː," sɛd mɒɹɪs, vɛɹi ɹiːzənəbli.
103180|20-000056|You can't please your father and me both;|juː kant pliːz jɔː fɑːðə and miː bəʊθ;
103181|20-000057|you must choose between us.|juː mʌst tʃuːz bɪtwiːn ʌs.
103182|20-000058|"I have chosen you!" she said passionately.| "aɪ hav tʃəʊzən juː!" ʃiː sɛd paʃənətli.
103183|20-000059|Then marry me next week.|ðɛn maɹi miː nɛkst wiːk.
103184|20-000060|She stood gazing at him.|ʃiː stʊd ɡeɪzɪŋ at hɪm.
103185|20-000061|Isn't there any other way?|ɪsnt ðeə ɛni ʌðə weɪ?

103187|20-000063|If there is, I should be happy to hear of it.|ɪf ðeə ɪz, aɪ ʃʊd biː hapi tuː hiə ɒv ɪt.
103188|20-000064|Catherine could think of nothing of the kind, and Morris's luminosity seemed almost pitiless.|kaθɹɪn kʊd θɪŋk ɒv nʌθɪŋ ɒv ðə kaɪnd, and mɒɹɪs luːmɪnɒsɪti siːmd ɔːlməʊst pɪtiləs.
103189|20-000065|The only thing she could think of was that her father might, after all, come round, and she articulated, with an awkward sense of her helplessness in doing so, a wish that this miracle might happen.|ðə əʊnli θɪŋ ʃiː kʊd θɪŋk ɒv wɒz ðat hɜː fɑːðə maɪt, aftə ɔːl, kʌm ɹaʊnd, and ʃiː ɑːtɪkjʊleɪtɪd, wɪð an ɔːkwəd sɛns ɒv hɜː hɛlpləsnəs ɪn duːɪŋ səʊ, eɪ wɪʃ ðat ðɪs mɪɹəkəl maɪt hapən.

103191|20-000067|It would be, if he could only know you!|ɪt wʊd biː, ɪf hiː kʊd əʊnli nəʊ juː!
103192|20-000068|He can know me if he will.|hiː kan nəʊ miː ɪf hiː wɪl.
103193|20-000069|What is to prevent it?|wɒt ɪz tuː pɹɪvɛnt ɪt?
103194|20-000070|"His ideas, his reasons," said Catherine.| "hɪz aɪdiəz, hɪz ɹiːzənz," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
103195|20-000071|They are so -- so terribly strong.|ðeɪ ɑː səʊ -- səʊ tɛɹɪbli stɹɒŋ.
103196|20-000072|She trembled with the recollection of them yet.|ʃiː tɹɛmbəld wɪð ðə ɹɛkəlɛkʃən ɒv ðɛm jɛt.
103197|20-000073|"Strong?" cried Morris.| "stɹɒŋ?" kɹaɪd mɒɹɪs.
103198|20-000074|I would rather you should think them weak.|aɪ wʊd ɹɑːðə juː ʃʊd θɪŋk ðɛm wiːk.
103199|20-000075|"Oh, nothing about my father is weak!" said the girl.| "əʊ, nʌθɪŋ ɐbaʊt maɪ fɑːðə ɪz wiːk!" sɛd ðə ɡɜːl.
103200|20-000076|Morris turned away, walking to the window, where he stood looking out.|mɒɹɪs tɜːnd ɐweɪ, wɔːkɪŋ tuː ðə wɪndəʊ, weə hiː stʊd lʊkɪŋ aʊt.
103201|20-000077|"You are terribly afraid of him!" he remarked at last.| "juː ɑː tɛɹɪbli ɐfɹeɪd ɒv hɪm!" hiː ɹɪmɑːkt at last.
103202|20-000078|She felt no impulse to deny it, because she had no shame in it;|ʃiː fɛlt nəʊ ɪmpʌls tuː dɪnaɪ ɪt, bɪkɒz ʃiː had nəʊ ʃeɪm ɪn ɪt;
103203|20-000079|for if it was no honour to herself, at least it was an honour to him.|fɔː ɪf ɪt wɒz nəʊ ɒnə tuː hɜːsɛlf, at liːst ɪt wɒz an ɒnə tuː hɪm.
103204|20-000080|"I suppose I must be," she said simply.| "aɪ səpəʊz aɪ mʌst biː," ʃiː sɛd sɪmpli.
103205|20-000081|Then you don't love me -- not as I love you.|ðɛn juː dəʊnt lʌv miː -- nɒt az aɪ lʌv juː.
103206|20-000082|If you fear your father more than you love me, then your love is not what I hoped it was.|ɪf juː fiə jɔː fɑːðə mɔː ðɐn juː lʌv miː, ðɛn jɔː lʌv ɪz nɒt wɒt aɪ həʊpt ɪt wɒz.
103207|20-000083|"Ah, my friend!" she said, going to him.| "ɑː, maɪ fɹɛnd!" ʃiː sɛd, ɡəʊɪŋ tuː hɪm.
103208|20-000084|"Do I fear anything?" he demanded, turning round on her.| "duː aɪ fiə ɛnɪθɪŋ?" hiː dɪmandɪd, tɜːnɪŋ ɹaʊnd ɒn hɜː.
103209|20-000085|For your sake what am I not ready to face?|fɔː jɔː seɪk wɒt am aɪ nɒt ɹɛdi tuː feɪs?
103211|20-000087|Small good it does me, if you are so timid.|smɔːl ɡʊd ɪt dʌz miː, ɪf juː ɑː səʊ tɪmɪd.
103212|20-000088|"I don't think that I am -- really," said Catherine.| "aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk ðat aɪ am -- ɹiəlɪ," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
103213|20-000089|I don't know what you mean by 'really.' It is really enough to make us miserable.|aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ wɒt juː miːn baɪ 'ɹiəlɪ. ɪt ɪz ɹiəlɪ ɪnʌf tuː meɪk ʌs mɪzɹəbəl.
103214|20-000090|I should be strong enough to wait -- to wait a long time.|aɪ ʃʊd biː stɹɒŋ ɪnʌf tuː weɪt -- tuː weɪt eɪ lɒŋ taɪm.
103215|20-000091|And suppose after a long time your father should hate me worse than ever?|and səpəʊz aftə eɪ lɒŋ taɪm jɔː fɑːðə ʃʊd heɪt miː wɜːs ðɐn ɛvə?
103216|20-000092|He wouldn't -- he couldn't!|hiː wʊdnt -- hiː kʊdnt!
103217|20-000093|He would be touched by my fidelity?|hiː wʊd biː tʌtʃt baɪ maɪ fɪdɛlɪti?
103218|20-000094|Is that what you mean?|ɪz ðat wɒt juː miːn?
103219|20-000095|If he is so easily touched, then why should you be afraid of him?|ɪf hiː ɪz səʊ iːzili tʌtʃt, ðɛn waɪ ʃʊd juː biː ɐfɹeɪd ɒv hɪm?
103220|20-000096|This was much to the point, and Catherine was struck by it.|ðɪs wɒz mʌtʃ tuː ðə pɔɪnt, and kaθɹɪn wɒz stɹʌk baɪ ɪt.
103221|20-000097|"I will try not to be," she said.| "aɪ wɪl tɹaɪ nɒt tuː biː," ʃiː sɛd.
103222|20-000098|And she stood there submissively, the image, in advance, of a dutiful and responsible wife.|and ʃiː stʊd ðeə səbmɪsɪvli, ðə ɪmɪdʒ, ɪn ɐdvans, ɒv eɪ djuːtifəl and ɹɪspɒnsɪbəl waɪf.
103223|20-000099|This image could not fail to recommend itself to Morris Townsend, and he continued to give proof of the high estimation in which he held her.|ðɪs ɪmɪdʒ kʊd nɒt feɪl tuː ɹɛkəmɛnd ɪtsɛlf tuː mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd, and hiː kəntɪnjuːd tuː ɡɪv pɹuːf ɒv ðə haɪ ɛstɪmeɪʃən ɪn wɪtʃ hiː hɛld hɜː.
103225|20-000101|"Yes, Aunt Penniman would like that," Catherine said simply -- and yet with a certain shrewdness.| "jɛs, ant pɛnɪmən wʊd laɪk ðat," kaθɹɪn sɛd sɪmpli -- and jɛt wɪð eɪ sɜːtən ʃɹuːdnəs.
103227|20-000103|It was quite on her conscience to deliver this message, and had the mission been ten times more painful she would have as scrupulously performed it.|ɪt wɒz kwaɪt ɒn hɜː kɒnʃəns tuː dɪlɪvə ðɪs mɛsɪdʒ, and had ðə mɪʃən biːn tɛn taɪmz mɔː peɪnfəl ʃiː wʊd hav az skɹuːpjʊləsli pəfɔːmd ɪt.
103228|20-000104|He told me to tell you -- to tell you very distinctly, and directly from himself, that if I marry without his consent, I shall not inherit a penny of his fortune.|hiː təʊld miː tuː tɛl juː -- tuː tɛl juː vɛɹi dɪstɪŋktli, and daɪɹɛktli fɹɒm hɪmsɛlf, ðat ɪf aɪ maɹi wɪðaʊt hɪz kənsɛnt, aɪ ʃal nɒt ɪnhɛɹɪt eɪ pɛni ɒv hɪz fɔːtʃuːn.
103229|20-000105|He made a great point of this.|hiː meɪd eɪ ɡɹeɪt pɔɪnt ɒv ðɪs.
103230|20-000106|He seemed to think -- he seemed to think|hiː siːmd tuː θɪŋk -- hiː siːmd tuː θɪŋk
103231|20-000107|Morris flushed, as any young man of spirit might have flushed at an imputation of baseness.|mɒɹɪs flʌʃt, az ɛni jʌŋ man ɒv spɪɹɪt maɪt hav flʌʃt at an ɪmpjuːteɪʃən ɒv beɪsnəs.
103232|20-000108|What did he seem to think?|wɒt dɪd hiː siːm tuː θɪŋk?
103233|20-000109|That it would make a difference.|ðat ɪt wʊd meɪk eɪ dɪfɹəns.
103234|20-000110|It will make a difference -- in many things.|ɪt wɪl meɪk eɪ dɪfɹəns -- ɪn mɛni θɪŋz.
103235|20-000111|We shall be by many thousands of dollars the poorer;|wiː ʃal biː baɪ mɛni θaʊzəndz ɒv dɒləz ðə pʊəɹə;
103236|20-000112|and that is a great difference.|and ðat ɪz eɪ ɡɹeɪt dɪfɹəns.
103237|20-000113|But it will make none in my affection.|bʌt ɪt wɪl meɪk nʌn ɪn maɪ ɐfɛkʃən.
103238|20-000114|"We shall not want the money," said Catherine;| "wiː ʃal nɒt wɒnt ðə mʌni," sɛd kaθɹɪn;
103239|20-000115|for you know I have a good deal myself.|fɔː juː nəʊ aɪ hav eɪ ɡʊd diːl maɪsɛlf.
103240|20-000116|Yes, my dear girl, I know you have something.|jɛs, maɪ diə ɡɜːl, aɪ nəʊ juː hav sʌmθɪŋ.
103241|20-000117|And he can't touch that!|and hiː kant tʌtʃ ðat!
103242|20-000118|"He would never," said Catherine.| "hiː wʊd nɛvə," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
103243|20-000119|My mother left it to me.|maɪ mʌðə lɛft ɪt tuː miː.
103244|20-000120|Morris was silent a while.|mɒɹɪs wɒz saɪlənt eɪ waɪl.
103245|20-000121|"He was very positive about this, was he?" he asked at last.| "hiː wɒz vɛɹi pɒzɪtɪv ɐbaʊt ðɪs, wɒz hiː?" hiː askt at last.
103246|20-000122|He thought such a message would annoy me terribly, and make me throw off the mask, eh?|hiː θɔːt sʌtʃ eɪ mɛsɪdʒ wʊd ɐnɔɪ miː tɛɹɪbli, and meɪk miː θɹəʊ ɒf ðə mask, eɪ?
103247|20-000123|"I don't know what he thought," said Catherine wearily.| "aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ wɒt hiː θɔːt," sɛd kaθɹɪn wiəɹili.
103248|20-000124|Please tell him that I care for his message as much as for that!|pliːz tɛl hɪm ðat aɪ keə fɔː hɪz mɛsɪdʒ az mʌtʃ az fɔː ðat!
103249|20-000125|And Morris snapped his fingers sonorously.|and mɒɹɪs snapt hɪz fɪŋɡəz sɒnəɹəsli.
103250|20-000126|I don't think I could tell him that.|aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk aɪ kʊd tɛl hɪm ðat.
103251|20-000127|"Do you know you sometimes disappoint me?" said Morris.| "duː juː nəʊ juː sʌmtaɪmz dɪsɐpɔɪnt miː?" sɛd mɒɹɪs.
103252|20-000128|I should think I might.|aɪ ʃʊd θɪŋk aɪ maɪt.
103253|20-000129|I disappoint every one -- father and Aunt Penniman.|aɪ dɪsɐpɔɪnt ɛvɹɪ wɒn -- fɑːðə and ant pɛnɪmən.
103254|20-000130|Well, it doesn't matter with me, because I am fonder of you than they are.|wɛl, ɪt dʌzənt matə wɪð miː, bɪkɒz aɪ am fɒndə ɒv juː ðɐn ðeɪ ɑː.
103256|20-000132|Is it your belief that he will stick to it -- stick to it for ever, to this idea of disinheriting you? -- that your goodness and patience will never wear out his cruelty?|ɪz ɪt jɔː bɪliːf ðat hiː wɪl stɪk tuː ɪt -- stɪk tuː ɪt fɔː ɛvə, tuː ðɪs aɪdiə ɒv dɪsɪnhɛɹɪtɪŋ juː? -- ðat jɔː ɡʊdnəs and peɪʃəns wɪl nɛvə weə aʊt hɪz kɹuːəlti?
103257|20-000133|The trouble is that if I marry you, he will think I am not good.|ðə tɹʌbəl ɪz ðat ɪf aɪ maɹi juː, hiː wɪl θɪŋk aɪ am nɒt ɡʊd.
103258|20-000134|He will think that a proof.|hiː wɪl θɪŋk ðat eɪ pɹuːf.
103259|20-000135|Ah, then, he will never forgive you!|ɑː, ðɛn, hiː wɪl nɛvə fəɡɪv juː!
103260|20-000136|This idea, sharply expressed by Morris's handsome lips, renewed for a moment, to the poor girl's temporarily pacified conscience, all its dreadful vividness.|ðɪs aɪdiə, ʃɑːpli ɛkspɹɛst baɪ mɒɹɪs handsʌm lɪps, ɹɪnjuːd fɔː eɪ məʊmənt, tuː ðə pʊə ɡɜːlz tɛmpəɹɛɹɪli pasɪfaɪd kɒnʃəns, ɔːl ɪts dɹɛdfəl vɪvɪdnəs.

103263|20-000139|"You don't like that word 'disinherited,'" he added in a moment.| "juː dəʊnt laɪk ðat wɜːd 'dɪsɪnhɛɹɪtɪd," hiː adɪd ɪn eɪ məʊmənt.
103264|20-000140|It isn't the money;|ɪt ɪsnt ðə mʌni;
103265|20-000141|it is that he should -- that he should feel so.|ɪt ɪz ðat hiː ʃʊd -- ðat hiː ʃʊd fiːl səʊ.
103266|20-000142|"I suppose it seems to you a kind of curse," said Morris.| "aɪ səpəʊz ɪt siːmz tuː juː eɪ kaɪnd ɒv kɜːs," sɛd mɒɹɪs.
103267|20-000143|It must be very dismal.|ɪt mʌst biː vɛɹi dɪzməl.
103268|20-000144|"But don't you think," he went on presently, "that if you were to try to be very clever, and to set rightly about it, you might in the end conjure it away?"| "bʌt dəʊnt juː θɪŋk," hiː wɛnt ɒn pɹɛzəntli, "ðat ɪf juː wɜː tuː tɹaɪ tuː biː vɛɹi klɛvə, and tuː sɛt ɹaɪtli ɐbaʊt ɪt, juː maɪt ɪn ðə ɛnd kʌndʒə ɪt ɐweɪ?"
103269|20-000145|"Don't you think," he continued further, in a tone of sympathetic speculation, "that a really clever woman, in your place, might bring him round at last?"| "dəʊnt juː θɪŋk," hiː kəntɪnjuːd fɜːðə, ɪn eɪ təʊn ɒv sɪmpəθɛtɪk spɛkjʊleɪʃən, "ðat eɪ ɹiəlɪ klɛvə wʊmən, ɪn jɔː pleɪs, maɪt bɹɪŋ hɪm ɹaʊnd at last?"
103270|20-000146|Don't you think?|dəʊnt juː θɪŋk?
103271|20-000147|Here, suddenly, Morris was interrupted;|hiə, sʌdənli, mɒɹɪs wɒz ɪntəɹʌptɪd;
103272|20-000148|these ingenious inquiries had not reached Catherine's ears.|ðiːz ɪndʒiːniəs ɪŋkwaɪəɹiz had nɒt ɹiːtʃt kaθɹɪnz iəz.
103273|20-000149|The terrible word "disinheritance," with all its impressive moral reprobation, was still ringing there;|ðə tɛɹɪbəl wɜːd "dɪsɪnhɛɹɪtəns," wɪð ɔːl ɪts ɪmpɹɛsɪv mɒɹəl ɹɛpɹəbeɪʃən, wɒz stɪl ɹɪŋɪŋ ðeə;

103275|20-000151|The mortal chill of her situation struck more deeply into her child-like heart, and she was overwhelmed by a feeling of loneliness and danger.|ðə mɔːtəl tʃɪl ɒv hɜː sɪtʃuːeɪʃən stɹʌk mɔː diːpli ɪntʊ hɜː tʃaɪldlaɪk hɑːt, and ʃiː wɒz əʊvəwɛlmd baɪ eɪ fiːlɪŋ ɒv ləʊnlinəs and deɪndʒə.
103276|20-000152|But her refuge was there, close to her, and she put out her hands to grasp it.|bʌt hɜː ɹɛfjuːdʒ wɒz ðeə, kləʊs tuː hɜː, and ʃiː pʊt aʊt hɜː handz tuː ɡɹasp ɪt.

103280|21-000001|Doctor sloper very soon imparted his conviction to misess Almond, in the same terms in which he had announced it to himself.|dɒktə sləʊpə vɛɹi suːn ɪmpɑːtɪd hɪz kənvɪkʃən tuː mɪsɛs ɒlmənd, ɪn ðə seɪm tɜːmz ɪn wɪtʃ hiː had ɐnaʊnst ɪt tuː hɪmsɛlf.

103290|21-000011|"Doesn't geometry treat of surfaces?" asked misess Almond, who, as we know, was clever, smiling.| "dʌzənt dʒiɒmətɹi tɹiːt ɒv sɜːfɪsɪz?" askt mɪsɛs ɒlmənd, huː, az wiː nəʊ, wɒz klɛvə, smaɪlɪŋ.
103291|21-000012|Yes;|jɛs;
103292|21-000013|but it treats of them profoundly.|bʌt ɪt tɹiːts ɒv ðɛm pɹəfaʊndli.
103293|21-000014|Catherine and her young man are my surfaces;|kaθɹɪn and hɜː jʌŋ man ɑː maɪ sɜːfɪsɪz;
103294|21-000015|I have taken their measure.|aɪ hav teɪkən ðeə mɛʒə.
103295|21-000016|You speak as if it surprised you.|juː spiːk az ɪf ɪt səpɹaɪzd juː.
103296|21-000017|It is immense;|ɪt ɪz ɪmɛns;
103297|21-000018|there will be a great deal to observe.|ðeə wɪl biː eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl tuː ɒbzɜːv.
103298|21-000019|"You are shockingly cold-blooded!" said misess Almond.| "juː ɑː ʃɒkɪŋli kəʊldblʌdɪd!" sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd.
103299|21-000020|I need to be with all this hot blood about me.|aɪ niːd tuː biː wɪð ɔːl ðɪs hɒt blʌd ɐbaʊt miː.
103300|21-000021|Young Townsend indeed is cool;|jʌŋ taʊnsɛnd ɪndiːd ɪz kuːl;
103301|21-000022|I must allow him that merit.|aɪ mʌst ɐlaʊ hɪm ðat mɛɹɪt.
103302|21-000023|"I can't judge him," misess Almond answered;| "aɪ kant dʒʌdʒ hɪm," mɪsɛs ɒlmənd ansəd;
103303|21-000024|but I am not at all surprised at Catherine.|bʌt aɪ am nɒt at ɔːl səpɹaɪzd at kaθɹɪn.
103305|21-000026|she must have been so deucedly divided and bothered.|ʃiː mʌst hav biːn səʊ djuːsɪdli dɪvaɪdɪd and bɒðəd.
103306|21-000027|Say it amuses you outright!|seɪ ɪt ɐmjuːzɪz juː aʊtɹaɪt!
103307|21-000028|I don't see why it should be such a joke that your daughter adores you.|aɪ dəʊnt siː waɪ ɪt ʃʊd biː sʌtʃ eɪ dʒəʊk ðat jɔː dɔːtə ɐdɔːz juː.
103308|21-000029|It is the point where the adoration stops that I find it interesting to fix.|ɪt ɪz ðə pɔɪnt weə ðə adəɹeɪʃən stɒps ðat aɪ faɪnd ɪt ɪntɹɪstɪŋ tuː fɪks.
103309|21-000030|It stops where the other sentiment begins.|ɪt stɒps weə ðə ʌðə sɛntɪmənt bɪɡɪnz.
103310|21-000031|Not at all -- that would be simple enough.|nɒt at ɔːl -- ðat wʊd biː sɪmpəl ɪnʌf.
103311|21-000032|The two things are extremely mixed up, and the mixture is extremely odd.|ðə tuː θɪŋz ɑː ɛkstɹiːmli mɪkst ʌp, and ðə mɪkstʃə ɪz ɛkstɹiːmli ɒd.
103312|21-000033|It will produce some third element, and that's what I am waiting to see.|ɪt wɪl pɹədjuːs sʌm θɜːd ɛlɪmənt, and ðats wɒt aɪ am weɪtɪŋ tuː siː.
103313|21-000034|I wait with suspense -- with positive excitement;|aɪ weɪt wɪð səspɛns -- wɪð pɒzɪtɪv ɛksaɪtmənt;
103314|21-000035|and that is a sort of emotion that I didn't suppose Catherine would ever provide for me.|and ðat ɪz eɪ sɔːt ɒv ɪməʊʃən ðat aɪ dɪdnt səpəʊz kaθɹɪn wʊd ɛvə pɹəvaɪd fɔː miː.
103315|21-000036|I am really very much obliged to her.|aɪ am ɹiəlɪ vɛɹi mʌtʃ əblaɪdʒd tuː hɜː.
103316|21-000037|"She will cling," said misess Almond;| "ʃiː wɪl klɪŋ," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd;
103317|21-000038|she will certainly cling.|ʃiː wɪl sɜːtənli klɪŋ.
103318|21-000039|Yes;|jɛs;
103319|21-000040|as I say, she will stick.|az aɪ seɪ, ʃiː wɪl stɪk.
103320|21-000041|Cling is prettier.|klɪŋ ɪz pɹɪtiə.
103321|21-000042|That's what those very simple natures always do, and nothing could be simpler than Catherine.|ðats wɒt ðəʊz vɛɹi sɪmpəl neɪtʃəz ɔːlweɪz duː, and nʌθɪŋ kʊd biː sɪmplə ðɐn kaθɹɪn.
103322|21-000043|She doesn't take many impressions;|ʃiː dʌzənt teɪk mɛni ɪmpɹɛʃənz;
103323|21-000044|but when she takes one she keeps it.|bʌt wɛn ʃiː teɪks wɒn ʃiː kiːps ɪt.
103324|21-000045|She is like a copper kettle that receives a dent;|ʃiː ɪz laɪk eɪ kɒpə kɛtəl ðat ɹɪsiːvz eɪ dɛnt;
103325|21-000046|you may polish up the kettle, but you can't efface the mark.|juː meɪ pɒlɪʃ ʌp ðə kɛtəl, bʌt juː kant ɪfeɪs ðə mɑːk.
103326|21-000047|"We must try and polish up Catherine," said the Doctor.| "wiː mʌst tɹaɪ and pɒlɪʃ ʌp kaθɹɪn," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
103327|21-000048|I will take her to Europe.|aɪ wɪl teɪk hɜː tuː jʊəɹəp.
103328|21-000049|She won't forget him in Europe.|ʃiː wɒnt fəɡɛt hɪm ɪn jʊəɹəp.
103329|21-000050|He will forget her, then.|hiː wɪl fəɡɛt hɜː, ðɛn.
103330|21-000051|misess Almond looked grave.|mɪsɛs ɒlmənd lʊkt ɡɹeɪv.
103331|21-000052|Should you really like that?|ʃʊd juː ɹiəlɪ laɪk ðat?
103332|21-000053|"Extremely!" said the Doctor.| "ɛkstɹiːmli!" sɛd ðə dɒktə.
103333|21-000054|misess Penniman, meanwhile, lost little time in putting herself again in communication with Morris Townsend.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, miːnwaɪl, lɒst lɪtəl taɪm ɪn pʊtɪŋ hɜːsɛlf ɐɡɛn ɪn kəmjuːnɪkeɪʃən wɪð mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
103334|21-000055|She requested him to favour her with another interview, but she did not on this occasion select an oyster saloon as the scene of their meeting.|ʃiː ɹɪkwɛstɪd hɪm tuː feɪvə hɜː wɪð ɐnʌðə ɪntəvjuː, bʌt ʃiː dɪd nɒt ɒn ðɪs əkeɪʒən sɪlɛkt an ɔɪstə sɐluːn az ðə siːn ɒv ðeə miːtɪŋ.
103336|21-000057|She picked out a less elegant resort, and on issuing from its portal at the hour she had fixed she saw the young man standing apart.|ʃiː pɪkt aʊt eɪ lɛs ɛlɪɡənt ɹɪzɔːt, and ɒn ɪʃuːɪŋ fɹɒm ɪts pɔːtəl at ðə aʊə ʃiː had fɪkst ʃiː sɔː ðə jʌŋ man standɪŋ ɐpɑːt.
103337|21-000058|She offered him no recognition till she had crossed the street and he had followed her to some distance.|ʃiː ɒfəd hɪm nəʊ ɹɛkəɡnɪʃən tɪl ʃiː had kɹɒst ðə stɹiːt and hiː had fɒləʊd hɜː tuː sʌm dɪstəns.
103338|21-000059|Here, with a smile -- "Excuse my apparent want of cordiality," she said.|hiə, wɪð eɪ smaɪl -- "ɛkskjuːs maɪ ɐpaɹənt wɒnt ɒv kɔːdɪalɪti," ʃiː sɛd.
103339|21-000060|You know what to believe about that.|juː nəʊ wɒt tuː bɪliːv ɐbaʊt ðat.
103340|21-000061|Prudence before everything.|pɹuːdəns bɪfɔː ɛvɹɪθɪŋ.
103341|21-000062|And on his asking her in what direction they should walk, "Where we shall be least observed," she murmured.|and ɒn hɪz askɪŋ hɜː ɪn wɒt daɪɹɛkʃən ðeɪ ʃʊd wɔːk, "weə wiː ʃal biː liːst ɒbzɜːvd," ʃiː mɜːməd.
103342|21-000063|Morris was not in high good-humour, and his response to this speech was not particularly gallant.|mɒɹɪs wɒz nɒt ɪn haɪ ɡʊdhjuːmə, and hɪz ɹɪspɒns tuː ðɪs spiːtʃ wɒz nɒt pətɪkjʊləli ɡalənt.

103344|21-000065|Then he turned recklessly toward the centre of the town.|ðɛn hiː tɜːnd ɹɛkləsli təwɔːd ðə sɛntə ɒv ðə taʊn.
103345|21-000066|"I hope you have come to tell me that he has knocked under," he went on.| "aɪ həʊp juː hav kʌm tuː tɛl miː ðat hiː haz nɒkt ʌndə," hiː wɛnt ɒn.
103346|21-000067|I am afraid I am not altogether a harbinger of good;|aɪ am ɐfɹeɪd aɪ am nɒt ɔːltəɡɛðə eɪ hɑːbɪndʒə ɒv ɡʊd;

103348|21-000069|"I have been thinking a great deal, mister Townsend," said misess Penniman.| "aɪ hav biːn θɪŋkɪŋ eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl, mɪstə taʊnsɛnd," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
103349|21-000070|You think too much.|juː θɪŋk tuː mʌtʃ.
103350|21-000071|I suppose I do;|aɪ səpəʊz aɪ duː;

103354|21-000075|But I carry it as a queen carries her crown.|bʌt aɪ kaɹi ɪt az eɪ kwiːn kaɹiz hɜː kɹaʊn.
103355|21-000076|Would you believe that I have one now?|wʊd juː bɪliːv ðat aɪ hav wɒn naʊ?
103356|21-000077|I wouldn't, however, have missed our rendezvous for anything.|aɪ wʊdnt, haʊɛvə, hav mɪst aʊə ɹɒndɪvuː fɔː ɛnɪθɪŋ.
103357|21-000078|I have something very important to tell you.|aɪ hav sʌmθɪŋ vɛɹi ɪmpɔːtənt tuː tɛl juː.
103358|21-000079|"Well, let's have it," said Morris.| "wɛl, lɛts hav ɪt," sɛd mɒɹɪs.
103359|21-000080|I was perhaps a little headlong the other day in advising you to marry immediately.|aɪ wɒz pəhaps eɪ lɪtəl hɛdlɒŋ ðə ʌðə deɪ ɪn ɐdvaɪzɪŋ juː tuː maɹi ɪmiːdɪətli.

103362|21-000083|"Their number is infinite!" said misess Penniman, in a tone which seemed to suggest that this convenient faculty was one of her brightest attributes.| "ðeə nʌmbə ɪz ɪnfɪnət!" sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, ɪn eɪ təʊn wɪtʃ siːmd tuː sədʒɛst ðat ðɪs kənviːnɪənt fakəlti wɒz wɒn ɒv hɜː bɹaɪtɪst atɹɪbjuːts.

103364|21-000085|Ah!|ɑː!

103367|21-000088|It makes me a bad adviser, perhaps;|ɪt meɪks miː eɪ bad ɐdvaɪzə, pəhaps;

103374|21-000095|And is that bad advice or good?|and ɪz ðat bad ɐdvaɪs ɔː ɡʊd?
103375|21-000096|"That is not for me to say," misess Penniman rejoined, with some dignity.| "ðat ɪz nɒt fɔː miː tuː seɪ," mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɹɪdʒɔɪnd, wɪð sʌm dɪɡnɪti.
103376|21-000097|I only pretend it's sincere.|aɪ əʊnli pɹɪtɛnd ɪts sɪnsiə.

103381|21-000102|You know I am a poor woman.|juː nəʊ aɪ am eɪ pʊə wʊmən.
103382|21-000103|Morris had a speculative idea that she had a little property;|mɒɹɪs had eɪ spɛkjʊlətɪv aɪdiə ðat ʃiː had eɪ lɪtəl pɹɒpəti;
103383|21-000104|but he naturally did not press this.|bʌt hiː natʃəɹəli dɪd nɒt pɹɛs ðɪs.

103386|21-000107|misess Penniman hesitated a little.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən hɛzɪteɪtɪd eɪ lɪtəl.
103387|21-000108|I certainly do not regard Austin as a satisfactory Christian.|aɪ sɜːtənli duː nɒt ɹɪɡɑːd ɔːstɪn az eɪ satɪsfaktəɹi kɹɪstʃən.

103389|21-000110|Wait, at any rate, till he is less violent.|weɪt, at ɛni ɹeɪt, tɪl hiː ɪz lɛs vaɪələnt.

103391|21-000112|remember the prize is great!|ɹɪmɛmbə ðə pɹaɪz ɪz ɡɹeɪt!
103392|21-000113|Morris walked along some time in silence, tapping the railings and gateposts very sharply with his stick.|mɒɹɪs wɔːkt ɐlɒŋ sʌm taɪm ɪn saɪləns, tapɪŋ ðə ɹeɪlɪŋz and ɡeɪtpəʊsts vɛɹi ʃɑːpli wɪð hɪz stɪk.

103395|21-000116|misess Penniman was indeed inconsistent, for at this news she gave a little jump of gratification.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz ɪndiːd ɪŋkənsɪstənt, fɔː at ðɪs njuːz ʃiː ɡeɪv eɪ lɪtəl dʒʌmp ɒv ɡɹatɪfɪkeɪʃən.

103398|21-000119|Morris was a little vague about this.|mɒɹɪs wɒz eɪ lɪtəl veɪɡ ɐbaʊt ðɪs.

103401|21-000122|It's deuced awkward, now, to back out.|ɪts djuːst ɔːkwəd, naʊ, tuː bak aʊt.
103402|21-000123|misess Penniman, as I say, had stopped short;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, az aɪ seɪ, had stɒpt ʃɔːt;
103403|21-000124|and she stood there with her eyes fixed brilliantly on her companion.|and ʃiː stʊd ðeə wɪð hɜː aɪz fɪkst bɹɪliəntli ɒn hɜː kəmpaniən.

103405|21-000126|Catherine loves you so much that you may do anything.|kaθɹɪn lʌvz juː səʊ mʌtʃ ðat juː meɪ duː ɛnɪθɪŋ.
103406|21-000127|This declaration was slightly ambiguous, and Morris opened his eyes.|ðɪs dɛkləɹeɪʃən wɒz slaɪtli ambɪɡjuːəs, and mɒɹɪs əʊpənd hɪz aɪz.
103407|21-000128|I am happy to hear it!|aɪ am hapi tuː hiə ɪt!

103411|21-000132|Morris stood there still, with his raised eyebrows;|mɒɹɪs stʊd ðeə stɪl, wɪð hɪz ɹeɪzd aɪbɹaʊz;
103412|22-000001|he had slightly misrepresented the matter in saying that Catherine had consented to take the great step.|hiː had slaɪtli mɪsɹɛpɹɪzɛntɪd ðə matə ɪn seɪɪŋ ðat kaθɹɪn had kənsɛntɪd tuː teɪk ðə ɡɹeɪt stɛp.

103415|22-000004|He avoided, gracefully enough, fixing a day, though he left her under the impression that he had his eye on one.|hiː ɐvɔɪdɪd, ɡɹeɪsfəli ɪnʌf, fɪksɪŋ eɪ deɪ, ðəʊ hiː lɛft hɜː ʌndə ðə ɪmpɹɛʃən ðat hiː had hɪz aɪ ɒn wɒn.

103418|22-000007|The prize was certainly great;|ðə pɹaɪz wɒz sɜːtənli ɡɹeɪt;

103421|22-000010|Providence was more especially on the side of clever people, and clever people were known by an indisposition to risk their bones.|pɹɒvɪdəns wɒz mɔː ɪspɛʃəli ɒn ðə saɪd ɒv klɛvə piːpəl, and klɛvə piːpəl wɜː nəʊn baɪ an ɪndɪspəzɪʃən tuː ɹɪsk ðeə bəʊnz.
103422|22-000011|The ultimate reward of a union with a young woman who was both unattractive and impoverished ought to be connected with immediate disadvantages by some very palpable chain.|ðə ʌltɪmət ɹɪwɔːd ɒv eɪ juːniən wɪð eɪ jʌŋ wʊmən huː wɒz bəʊθ ʌnɐtɹaktɪv and ɪmpɒvəɹɪʃt ɔːt tuː biː kənɛktɪd wɪð ɪmiːdɪət dɪsɐdvantɪdʒɪz baɪ sʌm vɛɹi palpəbəl tʃeɪn.
103424|22-000013|a fact that should be remembered by readers disposed to judge harshly of a young man who may have struck them as making but an indifferently successful use of fine natural parts.|eɪ fakt ðat ʃʊd biː ɹɪmɛmbəd baɪ ɹiːdəz dɪspəʊzd tuː dʒʌdʒ hɑːʃli ɒv eɪ jʌŋ man huː meɪ hav stɹʌk ðɛm az meɪkɪŋ bʌt an ɪndɪfɹəntli səksɛsfəl juːs ɒv faɪn natʃəɹəl pɑːts.
103425|22-000014|He had not forgotten that in any event Catherine had her own ten thousand a year;|hiː had nɒt fəɡɒtən ðat ɪn ɛni ɪvɛnt kaθɹɪn had hɜː əʊn tɛn θaʊzənd eɪ jiə;

103427|22-000016|But with his fine parts he rated himself high, and he had a perfectly definite appreciation of his value, which seemed to him inadequately represented by the sum I have mentioned.|bʌt wɪð hɪz faɪn pɑːts hiː ɹeɪtɪd hɪmsɛlf haɪ, and hiː had eɪ pɜːfɛktlɪ dɛfɪnət ɐpɹiːʃɪeɪʃən ɒv hɪz valjuː, wɪtʃ siːmd tuː hɪm ɪnadɪkwətli ɹɛpɹɪzɛntɪd baɪ ðə sʌm aɪ hav mɛnʃənd.
103428|22-000017|At the same time he reminded himself that this sum was considerable, that everything is relative, and that if a modest income is less desirable than a large one, the complete absence of revenue is nowhere accounted an advantage.|at ðə seɪm taɪm hiː ɹɪmaɪndɪd hɪmsɛlf ðat ðɪs sʌm wɒz kənsɪdəɹəbəl, ðat ɛvɹɪθɪŋ ɪz ɹɛlətɪv, and ðat ɪf eɪ mɒdɪst ɪŋkʌm ɪz lɛs dɪzaɪəɹəbəl ðɐn eɪ lɑːdʒ wɒn, ðə kəmpliːt absəns ɒv ɹɛvənjuː ɪz nəʊweə ɐkaʊntɪd an ɐdvantɪdʒ.

103431|22-000020|The natural way to work it out was by marrying Catherine;|ðə natʃəɹəl weɪ tuː wɜːk ɪt aʊt wɒz baɪ maɹiɪŋ kaθɹɪn;
103432|22-000021|but in mathematics there are many short cuts, and Morris was not without a hope that he should yet discover one.|bʌt ɪn maθɪmatɪks ðeə ɑː mɛni ʃɔːt kʌts, and mɒɹɪs wɒz nɒt wɪðaʊt eɪ həʊp ðat hiː ʃʊd jɛt dɪskʌvə wɒn.
103433|22-000022|When Catherine took him at his word and consented to renounce the attempt to mollify her father, he drew back skilfully enough, as I have said, and kept the wedding-day still an open question.|wɛn kaθɹɪn tʊk hɪm at hɪz wɜːd and kənsɛntɪd tuː ɹɪnaʊns ðə ɐtɛmpt tuː mɒlɪfaɪ hɜː fɑːðə, hiː dɹuː bak skɪlfəli ɪnʌf, az aɪ hav sɛd, and kɛpt ðə wɛdɪŋdeɪ stɪl an əʊpən kwɛstʃən.
103434|22-000023|Her faith in his sincerity was so complete that she was incapable of suspecting that he was playing with her;|hɜː feɪθ ɪn hɪz sɪnsɛɹɪti wɒz səʊ kəmpliːt ðat ʃiː wɒz ɪŋkeɪpəbəl ɒv səspɛktɪŋ ðat hiː wɒz pleɪɪŋ wɪð hɜː;

103436|22-000025|The poor girl had an admirable sense of honour;|ðə pʊə ɡɜːl had an admɪɹəbəl sɛns ɒv ɒnə;
103438|22-000027|It was on her conscience that she ought to live under his roof only so long as she conformed to his wisdom.|ɪt wɒz ɒn hɜː kɒnʃəns ðat ʃiː ɔːt tuː laɪv ʌndə hɪz ɹuːf əʊnli səʊ lɒŋ az ʃiː kənfɔːmd tuː hɪz wɪzdəm.
103440|22-000029|She had cast her lot with a young man against whom he had solemnly warned her, and broken the contract under which he provided her with a happy home.|ʃiː had kast hɜː lɒt wɪð eɪ jʌŋ man ɐɡɛnst huːm hiː had sɒləmli wɔːnd hɜː, and bɹəʊkən ðə kɒntɹakt ʌndə wɪtʃ hiː pɹəvaɪdɪd hɜː wɪð eɪ hapi həʊm.

103443|22-000032|This was close reasoning;|ðɪs wɒz kləʊs ɹiːzənɪŋ;

103445|22-000034|Catherine's days at this time were dismal, and the weight of some of her hours was almost more than she could bear.|kaθɹɪnz deɪz at ðɪs taɪm wɜː dɪzməl, and ðə weɪt ɒv sʌm ɒv hɜː aʊəz wɒz ɔːlməʊst mɔː ðɐn ʃiː kʊd beə.
103446|22-000035|Her father never looked at her, never spoke to her.|hɜː fɑːðə nɛvə lʊkt at hɜː, nɛvə spəʊk tuː hɜː.

103448|22-000037|She looked at him as much as she dared (for she was afraid of seeming to offer herself to his observation), and she pitied him for the sorrow she had brought upon him.|ʃiː lʊkt at hɪm az mʌtʃ az ʃiː deəd (fɔː ʃiː wɒz ɐfɹeɪd ɒv siːmɪŋ tuː ɒfə hɜːsɛlf tuː hɪz ɒbzəveɪʃən), and ʃiː pɪtid hɪm fɔː ðə sɒɹəʊ ʃiː had bɹɔːt əpɒn hɪm.
103449|22-000038|She held up her head and busied her hands, and went about her daily occupations;|ʃiː hɛld ʌp hɜː hɛd and bɪzid hɜː handz, and wɛnt ɐbaʊt hɜː deɪli ɒkjʊpeɪʃənz;
103450|22-000039|and when the state of things in Washington Square seemed intolerable, she closed her eyes and indulged herself with an intellectual vision of the man for whose sake she had broken a sacred law.|and wɛn ðə steɪt ɒv θɪŋz ɪn wɒʃɪŋtən skweə siːmd ɪntɒləɹəbəl, ʃiː kləʊzd hɜː aɪz and ɪndʌldʒd hɜːsɛlf wɪð an ɪntəlɛktʃuːəl vɪʒən ɒv ðə man fɔː huːz seɪk ʃiː had bɹəʊkən eɪ seɪkɹɪd lɔː.

103452|22-000041|If Catherine was quiet, she was quietly quiet, as I may say, and her pathetic effects, which there was no one to notice, were entirely unstudied and unintended.|ɪf kaθɹɪn wɒz kwaɪət, ʃiː wɒz kwaɪətli kwaɪət, az aɪ meɪ seɪ, and hɜː pɐθɛtɪk ɪfɛkts, wɪtʃ ðeə wɒz nəʊ wɒn tuː nəʊtɪs, wɜː ɛntaɪəli ʌnstʌdid and ʌnɪntɛndɪd.

103455|22-000044|there was a richer rustle in the very deliberate movements to which she confined herself, and when she occasionally spoke, in connexion with some very trivial event, she had the air of meaning something deeper than what she said.|ðeə wɒz eɪ ɹɪtʃə ɹʌsəl ɪn ðə vɛɹi dɪlɪbəɹət muːvmənts tuː wɪtʃ ʃiː kənfaɪnd hɜːsɛlf, and wɛn ʃiː əkeɪʒənəli spəʊk, ɪn kənɛkʃən wɪð sʌm vɛɹi tɹɪvɪəl ɪvɛnt, ʃiː had ðə eə ɒv miːnɪŋ sʌmθɪŋ diːpə ðɐn wɒt ʃiː sɛd.

103459|22-000048|He also had something to say to her;|hiː ɔːlsəʊ had sʌmθɪŋ tuː seɪ tuː hɜː;

103461|22-000050|He was interested, as we know, in seeing how, if she were left to herself, she would "stick."|hiː wɒz ɪntɹɪstɪd, az wiː nəʊ, ɪn siːɪŋ haʊ, ɪf ʃiː wɜː lɛft tuː hɜːsɛlf, ʃiː wʊd "stɪk."
103462|22-000051|At last she told him she had seen Morris Townsend again, and that their relations remained quite the same.|at last ʃiː təʊld hɪm ʃiː had siːn mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd ɐɡɛn, and ðat ðeə ɹɪleɪʃənz ɹɪmeɪnd kwaɪt ðə seɪm.

103494|22-000083|It gave her such delight, after his words of the day before, to hear that he should "like" her to do something, and that he still had in his heart any of the tenderness of preference, that she gave a little exclamation of joy.|ɪt ɡeɪv hɜː sʌtʃ dɪlaɪt, aftə hɪz wɜːdz ɒv ðə deɪ bɪfɔː, tuː hiə ðat hiː ʃʊd "laɪk" hɜː tuː duː sʌmθɪŋ, and ðat hiː stɪl had ɪn hɪz hɑːt ɛni ɒv ðə tɛndənəs ɒv pɹɛfɹəns, ðat ʃiː ɡeɪv eɪ lɪtəl ɛksklɐmeɪʃən ɒv dʒɔɪ.

103506|22-000095|and yet there was something else that she felt as well, and that she presently expressed.|and jɛt ðeə wɒz sʌmθɪŋ ɛls ðat ʃiː fɛlt az wɛl, and ðat ʃiː pɹɛzəntli ɛkspɹɛst.
103507|22-000096|I sometimes think that if I do what you dislike so much, I ought not to stay with you.|aɪ sʌmtaɪmz θɪŋk ðat ɪf aɪ duː wɒt juː dɪslaɪk səʊ mʌtʃ, aɪ ɔːt nɒt tuː steɪ wɪð juː.
103508|22-000097|To stay with me?|tuː steɪ wɪð miː?
103509|22-000098|If I live with you, I ought to obey you.|ɪf aɪ laɪv wɪð juː, aɪ ɔːt tuː əʊbeɪ juː.
103511|22-000100|But if I don't obey you, I ought not to live with you -- to enjoy your kindness and protection.|bʌt ɪf aɪ dəʊnt əʊbeɪ juː, aɪ ɔːt nɒt tuː laɪv wɪð juː -- tuː ɛndʒɔɪ jɔː kaɪndnəs and pɹətɛkʃən.
103512|22-000101|This striking argument gave the Doctor a sudden sense of having underestimated his daughter;|ðɪs stɹaɪkɪŋ ɑːɡjuːmənt ɡeɪv ðə dɒktə eɪ sʌdən sɛns ɒv havɪŋ ʌndəɹɛstɪmeɪtɪd hɪz dɔːtə;
103513|22-000102|it seemed even more than worthy of a young woman who had revealed the quality of unaggressive obstinacy.|ɪt siːmd iːvən mɔː ðɐn wɜːði ɒv eɪ jʌŋ wʊmən huː had ɹɪviːld ðə kwɒlɪti ɒv ʌnɐɡɹɛsɪv ɒbstɪnəsi.
103514|22-000103|But it displeased him -- displeased him deeply, and he signified as much.|bʌt ɪt dɪspliːzd hɪm -- dɪspliːzd hɪm diːpli, and hiː sɪɡnɪfaɪd az mʌtʃ.
103515|22-000104|"That idea is in very bad taste," he said.| "ðat aɪdiə ɪz ɪn vɛɹi bad teɪst," hiː sɛd.
103516|22-000105|Did you get it from mister Townsend?|dɪd juː ɡɛt ɪt fɹɒm mɪstə taʊnsɛnd?
103517|22-000106|Oh no;|əʊ nəʊ;
103518|22-000107|"it's my own!" said Catherine eagerly.| "ɪts maɪ əʊn!" sɛd kaθɹɪn iːɡəli.
103519|23-000001|if Morris Townsend was not to be included in this journey, no more was misess Penniman, who would have been thankful for an invitation, but who (to do her justice) bore her disappointment in a perfectly ladylike manner.|ɪf mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd wɒz nɒt tuː biː ɪŋkluːdɪd ɪn ðɪs dʒɜːni, nəʊ mɔː wɒz mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː wʊd hav biːn θaŋkfəl fɔː an ɪnvɪteɪʃən, bʌt huː (tuː duː hɜː dʒʌstɪs) bɔː hɜː dɪsɐpɔɪntmənt ɪn eɪ pɜːfɛktlɪ leɪdilaɪk manə.
103520|23-000002|"I should enjoy seeing the works of Raphael and the ruins -- the ruins of the Pantheon," she said to misess Almond;| "aɪ ʃʊd ɛndʒɔɪ siːɪŋ ðə wɜːks ɒv ɹafeɪl and ðə ɹuːɪnz -- ðə ɹuːɪnz ɒv ðə panθɪən," ʃiː sɛd tuː mɪsɛs ɒlmənd;
103522|23-000004|I want rest;|aɪ wɒnt ɹɛst;
103523|23-000005|"I have been through so much in the last four months." misess Almond thought it rather cruel that her brother should not take poor Lavinia abroad;| "aɪ hav biːn θɹuː səʊ mʌtʃ ɪn ðə last fɔː mʌnθs." mɪsɛs ɒlmənd θɔːt ɪt ɹɑːðə kɹuːəl ðat hɜː bɹʌðə ʃʊd nɒt teɪk pʊə lavɪniə ɐbɹɔːd;
103524|23-000006|but she easily understood that, if the purpose of his expedition was to make Catherine forget her lover, it was not in his interest to give his daughter this young man's best friend as a companion.|bʌt ʃiː iːzili ʌndəstʊd ðat, ɪf ðə pɜːpəs ɒv hɪz ɛkspədɪʃən wɒz tuː meɪk kaθɹɪn fəɡɛt hɜː lʌvə, ɪt wɒz nɒt ɪn hɪz ɪntɹɪst tuː ɡɪv hɪz dɔːtə ðɪs jʌŋ manz bɛst fɹɛnd az eɪ kəmpaniən.
103527|23-000009|misess Penniman was perfectly aware that her brother's motive in undertaking a foreign tour was to lay a trap for Catherine's constancy;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz pɜːfɛktlɪ ɐweə ðat hɜː bɹʌðəz məʊtɪv ɪn ʌndəteɪkɪŋ eɪ fɒɹən tʊə wɒz tuː leɪ eɪ tɹap fɔː kaθɹɪnz kɒnstənsi;
103528|23-000010|and she imparted this conviction very frankly to her niece.|and ʃiː ɪmpɑːtɪd ðɪs kənvɪkʃən vɛɹi fɹaŋkli tuː hɜː niːs.
103529|23-000011|"He thinks it will make you forget Morris," she said (she always called the young man "Morris" now);| "hiː θɪŋks ɪt wɪl meɪk juː fəɡɛt mɒɹɪs," ʃiː sɛd (ʃiː ɔːlweɪz kɔːld ðə jʌŋ man "mɒɹɪs" naʊ);

103532|23-000014|Catherine looked greatly alarmed.|kaθɹɪn lʊkt ɡɹeɪtli ɐlɑːmd.
103533|23-000015|If he thinks that, I ought to tell him beforehand.|ɪf hiː θɪŋks ðat, aɪ ɔːt tuː tɛl hɪm bɪfɔːhand.
103534|23-000016|misess Penniman shook her head.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ʃʊk hɜː hɛd.
103535|23-000017|Tell him afterwards, my dear!|tɛl hɪm aftəwədz, maɪ diə!

103537|23-000019|That's the way to serve him.|ðats ðə weɪ tuː sɜːv hɪm.
103538|23-000020|And she added, in a softer key, that it must be delightful to think of those who love us among the ruins of the Pantheon.|and ʃiː adɪd, ɪn eɪ sɒftə kiː, ðat ɪt mʌst biː dɪlaɪtfəl tuː θɪŋk ɒv ðəʊz huː lʌv ʌs ɐmʌŋ ðə ɹuːɪnz ɒv ðə panθɪən.
103539|23-000021|Her father's displeasure had cost the girl, as we know, a great deal of deep-welling sorrow -- sorrow of the purest and most generous kind, without a touch of resentment or rancour;|hɜː fɑːðəz dɪsplɛʒə had kɒst ðə ɡɜːl, az wiː nəʊ, eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl ɒv diːpwəlɪŋ sɒɹəʊ -- sɒɹəʊ ɒv ðə pjʊəɹɪst and məʊst dʒɛnəɹəs kaɪnd, wɪðaʊt eɪ tʌtʃ ɒv ɹɪzɛntmənt ɔː ɹaŋkə;
103540|23-000022|but for the first time, after he had dismissed with such contemptuous brevity her apology for being a charge upon him, there was a spark of anger in her grief.|bʌt fɔː ðə fɜːst taɪm, aftə hiː had dɪsmɪst wɪð sʌtʃ kəntɛmptʃuːəs bɹɛvɪti hɜː ɐpɒlədʒi fɔː biːɪŋ eɪ tʃɑːdʒ əpɒn hɪm, ðeə wɒz eɪ spɑːk ɒv aŋɡə ɪn hɜː ɡɹiːf.
103541|23-000023|She had felt his contempt;|ʃiː had fɛlt hɪz kəntɛmpt;
103542|23-000024|it had scorched her;|ɪt had skɔːtʃt hɜː;
103543|23-000025|that speech about her bad taste made her ears burn for three days.|ðat spiːtʃ ɐbaʊt hɜː bad teɪst meɪd hɜː iəz bɜːn fɔː θɹiː deɪz.
103544|23-000026|During this period she was less considerate;|djʊəɹɪŋ ðɪs piəɹɪəd ʃiː wɒz lɛs kənsɪdəɹət;
103545|23-000027|she had an idea -- a rather vague one, but it was agreeable to her sense of injury -- that now she was absolved from penance, and might do what she chose.|ʃiː had an aɪdiə -- eɪ ɹɑːðə veɪɡ wɒn, bʌt ɪt wɒz ɐɡɹiːəbəl tuː hɜː sɛns ɒv ɪndʒəɹi -- ðat naʊ ʃiː wɒz ɐbsɒlvd fɹɒm pɛnəns, and maɪt duː wɒt ʃiː tʃəʊz.
103546|23-000028|She chose to write to Morris Townsend to meet her in the Square and take her to walk about the town.|ʃiː tʃəʊz tuː ɹaɪt tuː mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd tuː miːt hɜː ɪn ðə skweə and teɪk hɜː tuː wɔːk ɐbaʊt ðə taʊn.
103548|23-000030|She felt in every way at present more free and more resolute;|ʃiː fɛlt ɪn ɛvɹɪ weɪ at pɹɛzənt mɔː fɹiː and mɔː ɹɛzəluːt;
103549|23-000031|there was a force that urged her.|ðeə wɒz eɪ fɔːs ðat ɜːdʒd hɜː.
103550|23-000032|Now at last, completely and unreservedly, her passion possessed her.|naʊ at last, kəmpliːtli and ʌnɹɪzɜːvɪdli, hɜː paʃən pəzɛst hɜː.
103551|23-000033|Morris met her at last, and they took a long walk.|mɒɹɪs mɛt hɜː at last, and ðeɪ tʊk eɪ lɒŋ wɔːk.
103553|23-000035|It would be for six months, to Europe;|ɪt wʊd biː fɔː sɪks mʌnθs, tuː jʊəɹəp;
103554|23-000036|she would do absolutely what Morris should think best.|ʃiː wʊd duː absəluːtli wɒt mɒɹɪs ʃʊd θɪŋk bɛst.
103555|23-000037|She hoped inexpressibly that he would think it best she should stay at home.|ʃiː həʊpt ɪnɛkspɹɛsɪbli ðat hiː wʊd θɪŋk ɪt bɛst ʃiː ʃʊd steɪ at həʊm.
103556|23-000038|It was some time before he said what he thought: he asked, as they walked along, a great many questions.|ɪt wɒz sʌm taɪm bɪfɔː hiː sɛd wɒt hiː θɔːt: hiː askt, az ðeɪ wɔːkt ɐlɒŋ, eɪ ɡɹeɪt mɛni kwɛstʃənz.
103557|23-000039|There was one that especially struck her;|ðeə wɒz wɒn ðat ɪspɛʃəli stɹʌk hɜː;
103558|23-000040|it seemed so incongruous.|ɪt siːmd səʊ ɪŋkɒŋɡɹuːəs.

103561|23-000043|Gracious Heaven, what a dull woman!|ɡɹeɪʃəs hɛvən, wɒt eɪ dʌl wʊmən!
103562|23-000044|Morris exclaimed to himself.|mɒɹɪs ɛkskleɪmd tuː hɪmsɛlf.
103563|23-000045|"He thinks I will forget you," said Catherine: "that all these things will drive you out of my mind."| "hiː θɪŋks aɪ wɪl fəɡɛt juː," sɛd kaθɹɪn: "ðat ɔːl ðiːz θɪŋz wɪl dɹaɪv juː aʊt ɒv maɪ maɪnd."
103564|23-000046|Well, my dear, perhaps they will!|wɛl, maɪ diə, pəhaps ðeɪ wɪl!
103565|23-000047|"Please don't say that," Catherine answered gently, as they walked along.| "pliːz dəʊnt seɪ ðat," kaθɹɪn ansəd dʒɛntli, az ðeɪ wɔːkt ɐlɒŋ.
103566|23-000048|Poor father will be disappointed.|pʊə fɑːðə wɪl biː dɪsɐpɔɪntɪd.
103567|23-000049|Morris gave a little laugh.|mɒɹɪs ɡeɪv eɪ lɪtəl laf.
103568|23-000050|Yes, I verily believe that your poor father will be disappointed!|jɛs, aɪ vɛɹili bɪliːv ðat jɔː pʊə fɑːðə wɪl biː dɪsɐpɔɪntɪd!
103569|23-000051|"But you will have seen Europe," he added humorously.| "bʌt juː wɪl hav siːn jʊəɹəp," hiː adɪd hjuːməɹəsli.
103570|23-000052|What a take-in!|wɒt eɪ takiːn!
103571|23-000053|"I don't care for seeing Europe," Catherine said.| "aɪ dəʊnt keə fɔː siːɪŋ jʊəɹəp," kaθɹɪn sɛd.
103572|23-000054|You ought to care, my dear.|juː ɔːt tuː keə, maɪ diə.
103573|23-000055|And it may mollify your father.|and ɪt meɪ mɒlɪfaɪ jɔː fɑːðə.
103574|23-000056|Catherine, conscious of her obstinacy, expected little of this, and could not rid herself of the idea that in going abroad and yet remaining firm, she should play her father a trick.|kaθɹɪn, kɒnʃəs ɒv hɜː ɒbstɪnəsi, ɛkspɛktɪd lɪtəl ɒv ðɪs, and kʊd nɒt ɹɪd hɜːsɛlf ɒv ðə aɪdiə ðat ɪn ɡəʊɪŋ ɐbɹɔːd and jɛt ɹɪmeɪnɪŋ fɜːm, ʃiː ʃʊd pleɪ hɜː fɑːðə eɪ tɹɪk.

103577|23-000059|It will serve him right!|ɪt wɪl sɜːv hɪm ɹaɪt!

103580|23-000062|Be married when you come back.|biː maɹid wɛn juː kʌm bak.
103581|23-000063|You can buy your wedding clothes in Paris.|juː kan baɪ jɔː wɛdɪŋ kləʊðz ɪn paɹɪs.
103582|23-000064|And then Morris, with great kindness of tone, explained his view of the matter.|and ðɛn mɒɹɪs, wɪð ɡɹeɪt kaɪndnəs ɒv təʊn, ɛkspleɪnd hɪz vjuː ɒv ðə matə.
103583|23-000065|It would be a good thing that she should go;|ɪt wʊd biː eɪ ɡʊd θɪŋ ðat ʃiː ʃʊd ɡəʊ;
103584|23-000066|it would put them completely in the right.|ɪt wʊd pʊt ðɛm kəmpliːtli ɪn ðə ɹaɪt.
103585|23-000067|It would show they were reasonable and willing to wait.|ɪt wʊd ʃəʊ ðeɪ wɜː ɹiːzənəbəl and wɪlɪŋ tuː weɪt.
103587|23-000069|If there was a particle of chance that her father would be favourably affected by her going, that ought to settle it;|ɪf ðeə wɒz eɪ pɑːtɪkəl ɒv tʃans ðat hɜː fɑːðə wʊd biː feɪvəɹəbli ɐfɛktɪd baɪ hɜː ɡəʊɪŋ, ðat ɔːt tuː sɛtəl ɪt;
103588|23-000070|for, after all, Morris was very unwilling to be the cause of her being disinherited.|fɔː, aftə ɔːl, mɒɹɪs wɒz vɛɹi ʌnwɪlɪŋ tuː biː ðə kɔːz ɒv hɜː biːɪŋ dɪsɪnhɛɹɪtɪd.

103590|23-000072|He was willing to wait for her;|hiː wɒz wɪlɪŋ tuː weɪt fɔː hɜː;
103591|23-000073|it would be hard, but he could do it.|ɪt wʊd biː hɑːd, bʌt hiː kʊd duː ɪt.
103592|23-000074|And over there, among beautiful scenes and noble monuments, perhaps the old gentleman would be softened;|and əʊvə ðeə, ɐmʌŋ bjuːtifəl siːnz and nəʊbəl mɒnjuːmənts, pəhaps ðə əʊld dʒɛntəlmən wʊd biː sɒfənd;

103594|23-000076|He might be touched by her gentleness, her patience, her willingness to make any sacrifice but that one;|hiː maɪt biː tʌtʃt baɪ hɜː dʒɛntəlnəs, hɜː peɪʃəns, hɜː wɪlɪŋnəs tuː meɪk ɛni sakɹɪfaɪs bʌt ðat wɒn;
103595|23-000077|and if she should appeal to him some day, in some celebrated spot -- in Italy, say, in the evening;|and ɪf ʃiː ʃʊd ɐpiːl tuː hɪm sʌm deɪ, ɪn sʌm sɛləbɹeɪtɪd spɒt -- ɪn ɪtəli, seɪ, ɪn ðə iːvnɪŋ;
103596|23-000078|in Venice, in a gondola, by moonlight -- if she should be a little clever about it and touch the right chord, perhaps he would fold her in his arms and tell her that he forgave her.|ɪn vɛnɪs, ɪn eɪ ɡəndəʊlə, baɪ muːnlaɪt -- ɪf ʃiː ʃʊd biː eɪ lɪtəl klɛvə ɐbaʊt ɪt and tʌtʃ ðə ɹaɪt kɔːd, pəhaps hiː wʊd fəʊld hɜː ɪn hɪz ɑːmz and tɛl hɜː ðat hiː fəɡeɪv hɜː.
103597|23-000079|Catherine was immensely struck with this conception of the affair, which seemed eminently worthy of her lover's brilliant intellect;|kaθɹɪn wɒz ɪmɛnsli stɹʌk wɪð ðɪs kənsɛpʃən ɒv ðə ɐfeə, wɪtʃ siːmd ɛmɪnəntli wɜːði ɒv hɜː lʌvəz bɹɪliənt ɪntəlɛkt;

103599|23-000081|The idea of being "clever" in a gondola by moonlight appeared to her to involve elements of which her grasp was not active.|ðə aɪdiə ɒv biːɪŋ "klɛvə" ɪn eɪ ɡəndəʊlə baɪ muːnlaɪt ɐpiəd tuː hɜː tuː ɪnvɒlv ɛlɪmənts ɒv wɪtʃ hɜː ɡɹasp wɒz nɒt aktɪv.

103614|23-000096|"The same -- only more so!" said Morris, smiling.| "ðə seɪm -- əʊnli mɔː səʊ!" sɛd mɒɹɪs, smaɪlɪŋ.
103615|23-000097|It does not enter into our scheme to narrate in detail doctor Sloper's proceedings in the eastern hemisphere.|ɪt dʌz nɒt ɛntə ɪntʊ aʊə skiːm tuː nɐɹeɪt ɪn diːteɪl dɒktə sləʊpəz pɹəsiːdɪŋz ɪn ðə iːstən hɛmɪsfiə.
103616|23-000098|He made the grand tour of Europe, travelled in considerable splendour, and (as was to have been expected in a man of his high cultivation) found so much in art and antiquity to interest him, that he remained abroad, not for six months, but for twelve.|hiː meɪd ðə ɡɹand tʊə ɒv jʊəɹəp, tɹavəld ɪn kənsɪdəɹəbəl splɛndə, and (az wɒz tuː hav biːn ɛkspɛktɪd ɪn eɪ man ɒv hɪz haɪ kʌltɪveɪʃən) faʊnd səʊ mʌtʃ ɪn ɑːt and antɪkwɪti tuː ɪntɹɪst hɪm, ðat hiː ɹɪmeɪnd ɐbɹɔːd, nɒt fɔː sɪks mʌnθs, bʌt fɔː twɛlv.
103617|23-000099|misess Penniman, in Washington Square, accommodated herself to his absence.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, ɪn wɒʃɪŋtən skweə, ɐkɒmədeɪtɪd hɜːsɛlf tuː hɪz absəns.
103619|23-000101|To Morris Townsend, at least, it would have appeared that she made it singularly attractive.|tuː mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd, at liːst, ɪt wʊd hav ɐpiəd ðat ʃiː meɪd ɪt sɪŋɡjʊləli ɐtɹaktɪv.
103620|23-000102|He was altogether her most frequent visitor, and misess Penniman was very fond of asking him to tea.|hiː wɒz ɔːltəɡɛðə hɜː məʊst fɹiːkwənt vɪzɪtə, and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz vɛɹi fɒnd ɒv askɪŋ hɪm tuː tiː.
103621|23-000103|He had his chair -- a very easy one at the fireside in the back parlour (when the great mahogany sliding-doors, with silver knobs and hinges, which divided this apartment from its more formal neighbour, were closed), and he used to smoke cigars in the Doctor's study, where he often spent an hour in turning over the curious collections of its absent proprietor.|hiː had hɪz tʃeə -- eɪ vɛɹi iːzi wɒn at ðə faɪəsaɪd ɪn ðə bak pɑːlə (wɛn ðə ɡɹeɪt məhɒɡəni slɪdɪŋdɔːz, wɪð sɪlvə nɒbz and hɪndʒɪz, wɪtʃ dɪvaɪdɪd ðɪs ɐpɑːtmənt fɹɒm ɪts mɔː fɔːməl neɪbə, wɜː kləʊzd), and hiː juːzd tuː sməʊk sɪɡɑːz ɪn ðə dɒktəz stʌdi, weə hiː ɒfən spɛnt an aʊə ɪn tɜːnɪŋ əʊvə ðə kjʊəɹiəs kəlɛkʃənz ɒv ɪts absənt pɹəpɹaɪətə.
103622|23-000104|He thought misess Penniman a goose, as we know;|hiː θɔːt mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən eɪ ɡuːs, az wiː nəʊ;
103623|23-000105|but he was no goose himself, and, as a young man of luxurious tastes and scanty resources, he found the house a perfect castle of indolence.|bʌt hiː wɒz nəʊ ɡuːs hɪmsɛlf, and, az eɪ jʌŋ man ɒv lʌɡʒʊəɹiəs teɪsts and skanti ɹɪzɔːsɪz, hiː faʊnd ðə haʊs eɪ pɜːfɛkt kasəl ɒv ɪndələns.
103624|23-000106|It became for him a club with a single member.|ɪt bɪkeɪm fɔː hɪm eɪ klʌb wɪð eɪ sɪŋɡəl mɛmbə.
103625|23-000107|misess Penniman saw much less of her sister than while the Doctor was at home;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən sɔː mʌtʃ lɛs ɒv hɜː sɪstə ðɐn waɪl ðə dɒktə wɒz at həʊm;
103626|23-000108|for misess Almond had felt moved to tell her that she disapproved of her relations with mister Townsend.|fɔː mɪsɛs ɒlmənd had fɛlt muːvd tuː tɛl hɜː ðat ʃiː dɪsɐpɹuːvd ɒv hɜː ɹɪleɪʃənz wɪð mɪstə taʊnsɛnd.
103627|23-000109|She had no business to be so friendly to a young man of whom their brother thought so meanly, and misess Almond was surprised at her levity in foisting a most deplorable engagement upon Catherine.|ʃiː had nəʊ bɪznəs tuː biː səʊ fɹɛndli tuː eɪ jʌŋ man ɒv huːm ðeə bɹʌðə θɔːt səʊ miːnli, and mɪsɛs ɒlmənd wɒz səpɹaɪzd at hɜː lɛvɪti ɪn fɔɪstɪŋ eɪ məʊst dɪplɔːɹəbəl ɛŋɡeɪdʒmənt əpɒn kaθɹɪn.

103629|23-000111|He will make her a lovely husband!|hiː wɪl meɪk hɜː eɪ lʌvli hʌsbənd!

103631|23-000113|I only believe in good ones.|aɪ əʊnli bɪliːv ɪn ɡʊd wɒnz.

103633|23-000115|He will be an idle, amiable, selfish, and doubtless tolerably good-natured fellow.|hiː wɪl biː an aɪdəl, eɪmiəbəl, sɛlfɪʃ, and daʊtləs tɒləɹəbli ɡʊdnətʃəd fɛləʊ.
103634|23-000116|But if she doesn't get the money and he finds himself tied to her, Heaven have mercy on her!|bʌt ɪf ʃiː dʌzənt ɡɛt ðə mʌni and hiː faɪndz hɪmsɛlf taɪd tuː hɜː, hɛvən hav mɜːsi ɒn hɜː!
103635|23-000117|He will have none.|hiː wɪl hav nʌn.

103640|23-000122|it's a pity Catherine can't marry her!|ɪts eɪ pɪti kaθɹɪn kant maɹi hɜː!
103641|23-000123|misess Penniman had no appetite whatever for conversation with misess Montgomery, whose acquaintance she made no trouble to cultivate;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had nəʊ apɪtaɪt wɒtɛvə fɔː kɒnvəseɪʃən wɪð mɪsɛs mɒntɡɒməɹi, huːz ɐkweɪntəns ʃiː meɪd nəʊ tɹʌbəl tuː kʌltɪveɪt;
103642|23-000124|and the effect of this alarming forecast of her niece's destiny was to make her think it indeed a thousand pities that mister Townsend's generous nature should be embittered.|and ðə ɪfɛkt ɒv ðɪs ɐlɑːmɪŋ fɔːkast ɒv hɜː niːsɪz dɛstɪni wɒz tuː meɪk hɜː θɪŋk ɪt ɪndiːd eɪ θaʊzənd pɪtiz ðat mɪstə taʊnsɛndz dʒɛnəɹəs neɪtʃə ʃʊd biː ɛmbɪtəd.
103643|23-000125|Bright enjoyment was his natural element, and how could he be comfortable if there should prove to be nothing to enjoy?|bɹaɪt ɛndʒɔɪmənt wɒz hɪz natʃəɹəl ɛlɪmənt, and haʊ kʊd hiː biː kʌmftəbəl ɪf ðeə ʃʊd pɹuːv tuː biː nʌθɪŋ tuː ɛndʒɔɪ?
103644|23-000126|It became a fixed idea with misess Penniman that he should yet enjoy her brother's fortune, on which she had acuteness enough to perceive that her own claim was small.|ɪt bɪkeɪm eɪ fɪkst aɪdiə wɪð mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ðat hiː ʃʊd jɛt ɛndʒɔɪ hɜː bɹʌðəz fɔːtʃuːn, ɒn wɪtʃ ʃiː had ɐkjuːtnəs ɪnʌf tuː pəsiːv ðat hɜː əʊn kleɪm wɒz smɔːl.
103646|24-000002|partly on system, and partly because he had a great many other things to think about.|pɑːtli ɒn sɪstəm, and pɑːtli bɪkɒz hiː had eɪ ɡɹeɪt mɛni ʌðə θɪŋz tuː θɪŋk ɐbaʊt.
103647|24-000003|It was idle to attempt to ascertain the state of her affections without direct inquiry, because, if she had not had an expressive manner among the familiar influences of home, she failed to gather animation from the mountains of Switzerland or the monuments of Italy.|ɪt wɒz aɪdəl tuː ɐtɛmpt tuː asəteɪn ðə steɪt ɒv hɜː ɐfɛkʃənz wɪðaʊt daɪɹɛkt ɪŋkwaɪəɹi, bɪkɒz, ɪf ʃiː had nɒt had an ɛkspɹɛsɪv manə ɐmʌŋ ðə fəmɪliə ɪnfluːənsɪz ɒv həʊm, ʃiː feɪld tuː ɡaðə anɪmeɪʃən fɹɒm ðə maʊntɪnz ɒv swɪtsələnd ɔː ðə mɒnjuːmənts ɒv ɪtəli.
103648|24-000004|She was always her father's docile and reasonable associate -- going through their sight-seeing in deferential silence, never complaining of fatigue, always ready to start at the hour he had appointed over-night, making no foolish criticisms and indulging in no refinements of appreciation.|ʃiː wɒz ɔːlweɪz hɜː fɑːðəz dɒsəl and ɹiːzənəbəl ɐsəʊsɪeɪt -- ɡəʊɪŋ θɹuː ðeə saɪtsiːɪŋ ɪn dɛfəɹɛnʃəl saɪləns, nɛvə kəmpleɪnɪŋ ɒv fɐtiːɡ, ɔːlweɪz ɹɛdi tuː stɑːt at ðə aʊə hiː had ɐpɔɪntɪd əʊvənaɪt, meɪkɪŋ nəʊ fuːlɪʃ kɹɪtɪsɪzəmz and ɪndʌldʒɪŋ ɪn nəʊ ɹɪfaɪnmənts ɒv ɐpɹiːʃɪeɪʃən.
103649|24-000005|"She is about as intelligent as the bundle of shawls," the Doctor said;| "ʃiː ɪz ɐbaʊt az ɪntɛlɪdʒənt az ðə bʌndəl ɒv ʃɔːlz," ðə dɒktə sɛd;
103651|24-000007|But her father had expected this, and he was not constrained to set down her intellectual limitations as a tourist to sentimental depression;|bʌt hɜː fɑːðə had ɛkspɛktɪd ðɪs, and hiː wɒz nɒt kənstɹeɪnd tuː sɛt daʊn hɜː ɪntəlɛktʃuːəl lɪmɪteɪʃənz az eɪ tʊəɹɪst tuː sɛntɪmɛntəl dɪpɹɛʃən;
103652|24-000008|she had completely divested herself of the characteristics of a victim, and during the whole time that they were abroad she never uttered an audible sigh.|ʃiː had kəmpliːtli daɪvɛstɪd hɜːsɛlf ɒv ðə kaɹɪktəɹɪstɪks ɒv eɪ vɪktɪm, and djʊəɹɪŋ ðə həʊl taɪm ðat ðeɪ wɜː ɐbɹɔːd ʃiː nɛvə ʌtəd an ɔːdɪbəl saɪ.
103653|24-000009|He supposed she was in correspondence with Morris Townsend;|hiː səpəʊzd ʃiː wɒz ɪn kɒɹɪspɒndəns wɪð mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd;
103654|24-000010|but he held his peace about it, for he never saw the young man's letters, and Catherine's own missives were always given to the courier to post.|bʌt hiː hɛld hɪz piːs ɐbaʊt ɪt, fɔː hiː nɛvə sɔː ðə jʌŋ manz lɛtəz, and kaθɹɪnz əʊn mɪsɪvz wɜː ɔːlweɪz ɡɪvən tuː ðə kɜːɹiə tuː pəʊst.
103655|24-000011|She heard from her lover with considerable regularity, but his letters came enclosed in misess Penniman's;|ʃiː hɜːd fɹɒm hɜː lʌvə wɪð kənsɪdəɹəbəl ɹɛɡjʊlaɹɪti, bʌt hɪz lɛtəz keɪm ɛŋkləʊzd ɪn mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz;
103656|24-000012|so that whenever the Doctor handed her a packet addressed in his sister's hand, he was an involuntary instrument of the passion he condemned.|səʊ ðat wɛnɛvə ðə dɒktə handɪd hɜː eɪ pakɪt ɐdɹɛst ɪn hɪz sɪstəz hand, hiː wɒz an ɪnvɒləntəɹi ɪnstɹəmənt ɒv ðə paʃən hiː kəndɛmd.
103657|24-000013|Catherine made this reflexion, and six months earlier she would have felt bound to give him warning;|kaθɹɪn meɪd ðɪs ɹiːflɛksiən, and sɪks mʌnθs ɜːlɪə ʃiː wʊd hav fɛlt baʊnd tuː ɡɪv hɪm wɔːnɪŋ;
103658|24-000014|but now she deemed herself absolved.|bʌt naʊ ʃiː diːmd hɜːsɛlf ɐbsɒlvd.
103659|24-000015|There was a sore spot in her heart that his own words had made when once she spoke to him as she thought honour prompted;|ðeə wɒz eɪ sɔː spɒt ɪn hɜː hɑːt ðat hɪz əʊn wɜːdz had meɪd wɛn wʌns ʃiː spəʊk tuː hɪm az ʃiː θɔːt ɒnə pɹɒmptɪd;
103660|24-000016|she would try and please him as far as she could, but she would never speak that way again.|ʃiː wʊd tɹaɪ and pliːz hɪm az fɑː az ʃiː kʊd, bʌt ʃiː wʊd nɛvə spiːk ðat weɪ ɐɡɛn.
103661|24-000017|She read her lover's letters in secret.|ʃiː ɹiːd hɜː lʌvəz lɛtəz ɪn siːkɹɪt.
103662|24-000018|One day at the end of the summer, the two travellers found themselves in a lonely valley of the Alps.|wɒn deɪ at ðə ɛnd ɒv ðə sʌmə, ðə tuː tɹavɛləz faʊnd ðɛmsɛlvz ɪn eɪ ləʊnli valɪ ɒv ðə alps.
103663|24-000019|They were crossing one of the passes, and on the long ascent they had got out of the carriage and had wandered much in advance.|ðeɪ wɜː kɹɒsɪŋ wɒn ɒv ðə pasɪz, and ɒn ðə lɒŋ ɐsɛnt ðeɪ had ɡɒt aʊt ɒv ðə kaɹɪdʒ and had wɒndəd mʌtʃ ɪn ɐdvans.
103664|24-000020|After a while the Doctor descried a footpath which, leading through a transverse valley, would bring them out, as he justly supposed, at a much higher point of the ascent.|aftə eɪ waɪl ðə dɒktə dɪskɹeɪd eɪ fʊtpaθ wɪtʃ, liːdɪŋ θɹuː eɪ tɹansvɜːs valɪ, wʊd bɹɪŋ ðɛm aʊt, az hiː dʒʌstli səpəʊzd, at eɪ mʌtʃ haɪə pɔɪnt ɒv ðə ɐsɛnt.
103665|24-000021|They followed this devious way, and finally lost the path;|ðeɪ fɒləʊd ðɪs diːviəs weɪ, and faɪnəli lɒst ðə paθ;
103666|24-000022|the valley proved very wild and rough, and their walk became rather a scramble.|ðə valɪ pɹuːvd vɛɹi waɪld and ɹʌf, and ðeə wɔːk bɪkeɪm ɹɑːðə eɪ skɹambəl.
103667|24-000023|They were good walkers, however, and they took their adventure easily;|ðeɪ wɜː ɡʊd wɔːkəz, haʊɛvə, and ðeɪ tʊk ðeə ɐdvɛntʃə iːzili;
103668|24-000024|from time to time they stopped, that Catherine might rest;|fɹɒm taɪm tuː taɪm ðeɪ stɒpt, ðat kaθɹɪn maɪt ɹɛst;
103669|24-000025|and then she sat upon a stone and looked about her at the hard-featured rocks and the glowing sky.|and ðɛn ʃiː sat əpɒn eɪ stəʊn and lʊkt ɐbaʊt hɜː at ðə hɑːdfiːtʃəd ɹɒks and ðə ɡləʊɪŋ skaɪ.

103672|24-000028|In the west there was a great suffusion of cold, red light, which made the sides of the little valley look only the more rugged and dusky.|ɪn ðə wɛst ðeə wɒz eɪ ɡɹeɪt sʌfjuːʒən ɒv kəʊld, ɹɛd laɪt, wɪtʃ meɪd ðə saɪdz ɒv ðə lɪtəl valɪ lʊk əʊnli ðə mɔː ɹʌɡɪd and dʌski.
103673|24-000029|During one of their pauses, her father left her and wandered away to some high place, at a distance, to get a view.|djʊəɹɪŋ wɒn ɒv ðeə pɔːzɪz, hɜː fɑːðə lɛft hɜː and wɒndəd ɐweɪ tuː sʌm haɪ pleɪs, at eɪ dɪstəns, tuː ɡɛt eɪ vjuː.
103674|24-000030|He was out of sight;|hiː wɒz aʊt ɒv saɪt;
103675|24-000031|she sat there alone, in the stillness, which was just touched by the vague murmur, somewhere, of a mountain brook.|ʃiː sat ðeə ɐləʊn, ɪn ðə stɪlnəs, wɪtʃ wɒz dʒʌst tʌtʃt baɪ ðə veɪɡ mɜːmə, sʌmweə, ɒv eɪ maʊntɪn bɹʊk.
103676|24-000032|She thought of Morris Townsend, and the place was so desolate and lonely that he seemed very far away.|ʃiː θɔːt ɒv mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd, and ðə pleɪs wɒz səʊ dɛsələt and ləʊnli ðat hiː siːmd vɛɹi fɑː ɐweɪ.

103678|24-000034|she began to wonder what had become of him.|ʃiː bɪɡan tuː wʌndə wɒt had bɪkʌm ɒv hɪm.
103679|24-000035|But at last he reappeared, coming towards her in the clear twilight, and she got up, to go on.|bʌt at last hiː ɹiːɐpiəd, kʌmɪŋ təwɔːdz hɜː ɪn ðə kliə twaɪlaɪt, and ʃiː ɡɒt ʌp, tuː ɡəʊ ɒn.
103680|24-000036|He made no motion to proceed, however, but came close to her, as if he had something to say.|hiː meɪd nəʊ məʊʃən tuː pɹəsiːd, haʊɛvə, bʌt keɪm kləʊs tuː hɜː, az ɪf hiː had sʌmθɪŋ tuː seɪ.

103683|24-000039|Have you given him up?|hav juː ɡɪvən hɪm ʌp?
103684|24-000040|The question was unexpected, but Catherine was only superficially unprepared.|ðə kwɛstʃən wɒz ʌnɛkspɛktɪd, bʌt kaθɹɪn wɒz əʊnli suːpəfɪʃəli ʌnpɹɪpeəd.
103685|24-000041|"No, father!" she answered.| "nəʊ, fɑːðə!" ʃiː ansəd.
103686|24-000042|He looked at her again for some moments, without speaking.|hiː lʊkt at hɜː ɐɡɛn fɔː sʌm məʊmənts, wɪðaʊt spiːkɪŋ.

103689|24-000045|The Doctor looked up and down the valley, swinging his stick;|ðə dɒktə lʊkt ʌp and daʊn ðə valɪ, swɪŋɪŋ hɪz stɪk;
103690|24-000046|then he said to her, in the same low tone:|ðɛn hiː sɛd tuː hɜː, ɪn ðə seɪm ləʊ təʊn:
103691|24-000047|I am very angry.|aɪ am vɛɹi aŋɡɹi.

103693|24-000049|If he did, the place was well chosen;|ɪf hiː dɪd, ðə pleɪs wɒz wɛl tʃəʊzən;
103694|24-000050|this hard, melancholy dell, abandoned by the summer light, made her feel her loneliness.|ðɪs hɑːd, mɛləŋkɒli dɛl, ɐbandənd baɪ ðə sʌmə laɪt, meɪd hɜː fiːl hɜː ləʊnlinəs.

103696|24-000052|for a moment her fear was great.|fɔː eɪ məʊmənt hɜː fiə wɒz ɡɹeɪt.

103700|24-000056|and I assure you I can be very hard.|and aɪ əʃʊə juː aɪ kan biː vɛɹi hɑːd.
103701|24-000057|She could not think why he told her these things.|ʃiː kʊd nɒt θɪŋk waɪ hiː təʊld hɜː ðiːz θɪŋz.
103702|24-000058|Had he brought her there on purpose, and was it part of a plan?|had hiː bɹɔːt hɜː ðeə ɒn pɜːpəs, and wɒz ɪt pɑːt ɒv eɪ plan?
103703|24-000059|What was the plan?|wɒt wɒz ðə plan?
103704|24-000060|Catherine asked herself.|kaθɹɪn askt hɜːsɛlf.
103705|24-000061|Was it to startle her suddenly into a retractation -- to take an advantage of her by dread?|wɒz ɪt tuː stɑːtəl hɜː sʌdənli ɪntʊ eɪ ɹɪtɹɐkteɪʃən -- tuː teɪk an ɐdvantɪdʒ ɒv hɜː baɪ dɹɛd?
103706|24-000062|Dread of what?|dɹɛd ɒv wɒt?
103707|24-000063|The place was ugly and lonely, but the place could do her no harm.|ðə pleɪs wɒz ʌɡli and ləʊnli, bʌt ðə pleɪs kʊd duː hɜː nəʊ hɑːm.
103708|24-000064|There was a kind of still intensity about her father, which made him dangerous, but Catherine hardly went so far as to say to herself that it might be part of his plan to fasten his hand -- the neat, fine, supple hand of a distinguished physician -- in her throat.|ðeə wɒz eɪ kaɪnd ɒv stɪl ɪntɛnsɪti ɐbaʊt hɜː fɑːðə, wɪtʃ meɪd hɪm deɪndʒəɹəs, bʌt kaθɹɪn hɑːdli wɛnt səʊ fɑː az tuː seɪ tuː hɜːsɛlf ðat ɪt maɪt biː pɑːt ɒv hɪz plan tuː fasən hɪz hand -- ðə niːt, faɪn, sʌpəl hand ɒv eɪ dɪstɪŋɡwɪʃt fɪzɪʃən -- ɪn hɜː θɹəʊt.
103709|24-000065|Nevertheless, she receded a step.|nɛvəðəlɛs, ʃiː ɹɪsiːdɪd eɪ stɛp.
103710|24-000066|"I am sure you can be anything you please," she said.| "aɪ am ʃʊə juː kan biː ɛnɪθɪŋ juː pliːz," ʃiː sɛd.
103711|24-000067|And it was her simple belief.|and ɪt wɒz hɜː sɪmpəl bɪliːf.
103712|24-000068|"I am very angry," he replied, more sharply.| "aɪ am vɛɹi aŋɡɹi," hiː ɹɪplaɪd, mɔː ʃɑːpli.
103713|24-000069|Why has it taken you so suddenly?|waɪ haz ɪt teɪkən juː səʊ sʌdənli?
103714|24-000070|It has not taken me suddenly.|ɪt haz nɒt teɪkən miː sʌdənli.
103715|24-000071|I have been raging inwardly for the last six months.|aɪ hav biːn ɹeɪdʒɪŋ ɪnwədli fɔː ðə last sɪks mʌnθs.
103716|24-000072|But just now this seemed a good place to flare out.|bʌt dʒʌst naʊ ðɪs siːmd eɪ ɡʊd pleɪs tuː fleə aʊt.
103717|24-000073|It's so quiet, and we are alone.|ɪts səʊ kwaɪət, and wiː ɑː ɐləʊn.
103718|24-000074|"Yes, it's very quiet," said Catherine vaguely, looking about her.| "jɛs, ɪts vɛɹi kwaɪət," sɛd kaθɹɪn veɪɡli, lʊkɪŋ ɐbaʊt hɜː.
103719|24-000075|Won't you come back to the carriage?|wɒnt juː kʌm bak tuː ðə kaɹɪdʒ?
103720|24-000076|In a moment.|ɪn eɪ məʊmənt.
103721|24-000077|Do you mean that in all this time you have not yielded an inch?|duː juː miːn ðat ɪn ɔːl ðɪs taɪm juː hav nɒt jiːldɪd an ɪntʃ?
103722|24-000078|I would if I could, father;|aɪ wʊd ɪf aɪ kʊd, fɑːðə;
103723|24-000079|but I can't.|bʌt aɪ kant.
103724|24-000080|The Doctor looked round him too.|ðə dɒktə lʊkt ɹaʊnd hɪm tuː.
103725|24-000081|Should you like to be left in such a place as this, to starve?|ʃʊd juː laɪk tuː biː lɛft ɪn sʌtʃ eɪ pleɪs az ðɪs, tuː stɑːv?
103726|24-000082|"What do you mean?" cried the girl.| "wɒt duː juː miːn?" kɹaɪd ðə ɡɜːl.
103727|24-000083|That will be your fate -- that's how he will leave you.|ðat wɪl biː jɔː feɪt -- ðats haʊ hiː wɪl liːv juː.
103728|24-000084|He would not touch her, but he had touched Morris.|hiː wʊd nɒt tʌtʃ hɜː, bʌt hiː had tʌtʃt mɒɹɪs.
103729|24-000085|The warmth came back to her heart.|ðə wɔːmθ keɪm bak tuː hɜː hɑːt.
103730|24-000086|"That is not true, father," she broke out, "and you ought not to say it!"| "ðat ɪz nɒt tɹuː, fɑːðə," ʃiː bɹəʊk aʊt, "and juː ɔːt nɒt tuː seɪ ɪt!"
103731|24-000087|It is not right, and it's not true!|ɪt ɪz nɒt ɹaɪt, and ɪts nɒt tɹuː!
103732|24-000088|He shook his head slowly.|hiː ʃʊk hɪz hɛd sləʊli.
103733|24-000089|No, it's not right, because you won't believe it.|nəʊ, ɪts nɒt ɹaɪt, bɪkɒz juː wɒnt bɪliːv ɪt.
103734|24-000090|But it is true.|bʌt ɪt ɪz tɹuː.
103735|24-000091|Come back to the carriage.|kʌm bak tuː ðə kaɹɪdʒ.
103736|24-000092|He turned away, and she followed him;|hiː tɜːnd ɐweɪ, and ʃiː fɒləʊd hɪm;
103737|24-000093|he went faster, and was presently much in advance.|hiː wɛnt fastə, and wɒz pɹɛzəntli mʌtʃ ɪn ɐdvans.
103739|24-000095|By this time it had grown almost dark, and she ended by losing sight of him.|baɪ ðɪs taɪm ɪt had ɡɹəʊn ɔːlməʊst dɑːk, and ʃiː ɛndɪd baɪ luːzɪŋ saɪt ɒv hɪm.
103741|24-000097|In it sat her father, rigid and silent;|ɪn ɪt sat hɜː fɑːðə, ɹɪdʒɪd and saɪlənt;
103742|24-000098|in silence, too, she took her place beside him.|ɪn saɪləns, tuː, ʃiː tʊk hɜː pleɪs bɪsaɪd hɪm.
103743|24-000099|It seemed to her, later, in looking back upon all this, that for days afterwards not a word had been exchanged between them.|ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː, leɪtə, ɪn lʊkɪŋ bak əpɒn ɔːl ðɪs, ðat fɔː deɪz aftəwədz nɒt eɪ wɜːd had biːn ɛkstʃeɪndʒd bɪtwiːn ðɛm.
103744|24-000100|The scene had been a strange one, but it had not permanently affected her feeling towards her father, for it was natural, after all, that he should occasionally make a scene of some kind, and he had let her alone for six months.|ðə siːn had biːn eɪ stɹeɪndʒ wɒn, bʌt ɪt had nɒt pɜːmənəntli ɐfɛktɪd hɜː fiːlɪŋ təwɔːdz hɜː fɑːðə, fɔː ɪt wɒz natʃəɹəl, aftə ɔːl, ðat hiː ʃʊd əkeɪʒənəli meɪk eɪ siːn ɒv sʌm kaɪnd, and hiː had lɛt hɜː ɐləʊn fɔː sɪks mʌnθs.
103745|24-000101|The strangest part of it was that he had said he was not a good man;|ðə stɹeɪndʒɪst pɑːt ɒv ɪt wɒz ðat hiː had sɛd hiː wɒz nɒt eɪ ɡʊd man;
103746|24-000102|Catherine wondered a great deal what he had meant by that.|kaθɹɪn wʌndəd eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl wɒt hiː had mɛnt baɪ ðat.
103747|24-000103|The statement failed to appeal to her credence, and it was not grateful to any resentment that she entertained.|ðə steɪtmənt feɪld tuː ɐpiːl tuː hɜː kɹiːdəns, and ɪt wɒz nɒt ɡɹeɪtfəl tuː ɛni ɹɪzɛntmənt ðat ʃiː ɛntəteɪnd.
103748|24-000104|Even in the utmost bitterness that she might feel, it would give her no satisfaction to think him less complete.|iːvən ɪn ðə ʌtməʊst bɪtənəs ðat ʃiː maɪt fiːl, ɪt wʊd ɡɪv hɜː nəʊ satɪsfakʃən tuː θɪŋk hɪm lɛs kəmpliːt.
103749|24-000105|Such a saying as that was a part of his great subtlety -- men so clever as he might say anything and mean anything.|sʌtʃ eɪ seɪɪŋ az ðat wɒz eɪ pɑːt ɒv hɪz ɡɹeɪt sʌtəlti -- mɛn səʊ klɛvə az hiː maɪt seɪ ɛnɪθɪŋ and miːn ɛnɪθɪŋ.
103750|24-000106|And as to his being hard, that surely, in a man, was a virtue.|and az tuː hɪz biːɪŋ hɑːd, ðat ʃʊəli, ɪn eɪ man, wɒz eɪ vɜːtʃuː.
103751|24-000107|He let her alone for six months more -- six months during which she accommodated herself without a protest to the extension of their tour.|hiː lɛt hɜː ɐləʊn fɔː sɪks mʌnθs mɔː -- sɪks mʌnθs djʊəɹɪŋ wɪtʃ ʃiː ɐkɒmədeɪtɪd hɜːsɛlf wɪðaʊt eɪ pɹəʊtɛst tuː ðə ɛkstɛnʃən ɒv ðeə tʊə.
103752|24-000108|But he spoke again at the end of this time;|bʌt hiː spəʊk ɐɡɛn at ðə ɛnd ɒv ðɪs taɪm;
103753|24-000109|it was at the very last, the night before they embarked for New York, in the hotel at Liverpool.|ɪt wɒz at ðə vɛɹi last, ðə naɪt bɪfɔː ðeɪ ɛmbɑːkt fɔː njuː jɔːk, ɪn ðə həʊtɛl at lɪvəpuːl.
103754|24-000110|They had been dining together in a great dim, musty sitting-room;|ðeɪ had biːn daɪnɪŋ təɡɛðə ɪn eɪ ɡɹeɪt dɪm, mʌsti sɪtɪŋɡɹuːm;
103755|24-000111|and then the cloth had been removed, and the Doctor walked slowly up and down.|and ðɛn ðə klɒθ had biːn ɹɪmuːvd, and ðə dɒktə wɔːkt sləʊli ʌp and daʊn.
103756|24-000112|Catherine at last took her candle to go to bed, but her father motioned her to stay.|kaθɹɪn at last tʊk hɜː kandəl tuː ɡəʊ tuː bɛd, bʌt hɜː fɑːðə məʊʃənd hɜː tuː steɪ.
103758|24-000114|Do you mean about mister Townsend?|duː juː miːn ɐbaʊt mɪstə taʊnsɛnd?
103759|24-000115|About mister Townsend.|ɐbaʊt mɪstə taʊnsɛnd.
103760|24-000116|We shall probably marry.|wiː ʃal pɹɒbəbli maɹi.
103761|24-000117|The Doctor took several turns again while she waited.|ðə dɒktə tʊk sɛvɹəl tɜːnz ɐɡɛn waɪl ʃiː weɪtɪd.
103762|24-000118|Do you hear from him as much as ever?|duː juː hiə fɹɒm hɪm az mʌtʃ az ɛvə?
103763|24-000119|Yes;|jɛs;
103764|24-000120|"twice a month," said Catherine promptly.| "twaɪs eɪ mʌnθ," sɛd kaθɹɪn pɹɒmptli.
103765|24-000121|And does he always talk about marriage?|and dʌz hiː ɔːlweɪz tɔːk ɐbaʊt maɹɪdʒ?
103766|24-000122|Oh yes!|əʊ jɛs!
103768|24-000124|I am glad to hear he varies his subjects;|aɪ am ɡlad tuː hiə hiː veəɹiz hɪz sʌbdʒɛkts;
103769|24-000125|his letters might otherwise be monotonous.|hɪz lɛtəz maɪt ʌðəwaɪz biː mənɒtənəs.
103770|24-000126|"He writes beautifully," said Catherine, who was very glad of a chance to say it.| "hiː ɹaɪts bjuːtɪfəli," sɛd kaθɹɪn, huː wɒz vɛɹi ɡlad ɒv eɪ tʃans tuː seɪ ɪt.
103771|24-000127|They always write beautifully.|ðeɪ ɔːlweɪz ɹaɪt bjuːtɪfəli.
103772|24-000128|However, in a given case that doesn't diminish the merit.|haʊɛvə, ɪn eɪ ɡɪvən keɪs ðat dʌzənt dɪmɪnɪʃ ðə mɛɹɪt.
103773|24-000129|So, as soon as you arrive, you are going off with him?|səʊ, az suːn az juː ɐɹaɪv, juː ɑː ɡəʊɪŋ ɒf wɪð hɪm?
103774|24-000130|This seemed a rather gross way of putting it, and something that there was of dignity in Catherine resented it.|ðɪs siːmd eɪ ɹɑːðə ɡɹəʊs weɪ ɒv pʊtɪŋ ɪt, and sʌmθɪŋ ðat ðeə wɒz ɒv dɪɡnɪti ɪn kaθɹɪn ɹɪzɛntɪd ɪt.

103776|24-000132|"That's reasonable enough," her father answered.| "ðats ɹiːzənəbəl ɪnʌf," hɜː fɑːðə ansəd.
103777|24-000133|That's all I ask of you -- that you do tell me, that you give me definite notice.|ðats ɔːl aɪ ask ɒv juː -- ðat juː duː tɛl miː, ðat juː ɡɪv miː dɛfɪnət nəʊtɪs.
103779|24-000135|Oh, father, you will not lose me!|əʊ, fɑːðə, juː wɪl nɒt luːz miː!
103780|24-000136|Catherine said, spilling her candle-wax.|kaθɹɪn sɛd, spɪlɪŋ hɜː kandəlwaks.
103781|24-000137|"Three days before will do," he went on, "if you are in a position to be positive then."| "θɹiː deɪz bɪfɔː wɪl duː," hiː wɛnt ɒn, "ɪf juː ɑː ɪn eɪ pəzɪʃən tuː biː pɒzɪtɪv ðɛn."
103782|24-000138|He ought to be very thankful to me, do you know.|hiː ɔːt tuː biː vɛɹi θaŋkfəl tuː miː, duː juː nəʊ.
103783|24-000139|I have done a mighty good thing for him in taking you abroad;|aɪ hav dʌn eɪ maɪti ɡʊd θɪŋ fɔː hɪm ɪn teɪkɪŋ juː ɐbɹɔːd;

103785|24-000141|A year ago, you were perhaps a little limited -- a little rustic;|eɪ jiə ɐɡəʊ, juː wɜː pəhaps eɪ lɪtəl lɪmɪtɪd -- eɪ lɪtəl ɹʌstɪk;

103788|24-000144|Catherine turned away, and stood staring at the blank door.|kaθɹɪn tɜːnd ɐweɪ, and stʊd steəɹɪŋ at ðə blaŋk dɔː.
103789|24-000145|"Go to bed," said her father;| "ɡəʊ tuː bɛd," sɛd hɜː fɑːðə;

103791|25-000001|the voyage was indeed uncomfortable, and Catherine, on arriving in New York, had not the compensation of "going off," in her father's phrase, with Morris Townsend.|ðə vɔɪɪdʒ wɒz ɪndiːd ʌŋkʌmftəbəl, and kaθɹɪn, ɒn ɐɹaɪvɪŋ ɪn njuː jɔːk, had nɒt ðə kɒmpənseɪʃən ɒv "ɡəʊɪŋ ɒf," ɪn hɜː fɑːðəz fɹeɪz, wɪð mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
103792|25-000002|She saw him, however, the day after she landed;|ʃiː sɔː hɪm, haʊɛvə, ðə deɪ aftə ʃiː landɪd;
103793|25-000003|and, in the meantime, he formed a natural subject of conversation between our heroine and her Aunt Lavinia, with whom, the night she disembarked, the girl was closeted for a long time before either lady retired to rest.|and, ɪn ðə miːntaɪm, hiː fɔːmd eɪ natʃəɹəl sʌbdʒɛkt ɒv kɒnvəseɪʃən bɪtwiːn aʊə hɛɹəʊɪn and hɜː ant lavɪniə, wɪð huːm, ðə naɪt ʃiː dɪsɛmbɑːkt, ðə ɡɜːl wɒz klɒzɪtɪd fɔː eɪ lɒŋ taɪm bɪfɔː aɪðə leɪdi ɹɪtaɪəd tuː ɹɛst.

103800|25-000010|"I may almost say I have lived with him," misess Penniman proceeded, while Catherine stared.| "aɪ meɪ ɔːlməʊst seɪ aɪ hav lɪvd wɪð hɪm," mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən pɹəsiːdɪd, waɪl kaθɹɪn steəd.

103803|25-000013|"You will have the same -- or rather, you will have better!" and Aunt Lavinia smiled.| "juː wɪl hav ðə seɪm -- ɔː ɹɑːðə, juː wɪl hav bɛtə!" and ant lavɪniə smaɪld.
103804|25-000014|Then you will see what I mean.|ðɛn juː wɪl siː wɒt aɪ miːn.
103805|25-000015|It's a wonderful character, full of passion and energy, and just as true!|ɪts eɪ wʌndəfəl kaɹɪktə, fʊl ɒv paʃən and ɛnədʒi, and dʒʌst az tɹuː!
103806|25-000016|Catherine listened with a mixture of interest and apprehension.|kaθɹɪn lɪsənd wɪð eɪ mɪkstʃə ɒv ɪntɹɪst and apɹɪhɛnʃən.
103808|25-000018|To tell her story to some kind woman -- at moments it seemed to her that this would give her comfort, and she had more than once been on the point of taking the landlady, or the nice young person from the dressmaker's, into her confidence.|tuː tɛl hɜː stɔːɹi tuː sʌm kaɪnd wʊmən -- at məʊmənts ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː ðat ðɪs wʊd ɡɪv hɜː kʌmfət, and ʃiː had mɔː ðɐn wʌns biːn ɒn ðə pɔɪnt ɒv teɪkɪŋ ðə landleɪdi, ɔː ðə naɪs jʌŋ pɜːsən fɹɒm ðə dɹɛsmeɪkəz, ɪntʊ hɜː kɒnfɪdəns.
103809|25-000019|If a woman had been near her she would on certain occasions have treated such a companion to a fit of weeping;|ɪf eɪ wʊmən had biːn niə hɜː ʃiː wʊd ɒn sɜːtən əkeɪʒənz hav tɹiːtɪd sʌtʃ eɪ kəmpaniən tuː eɪ fɪt ɒv wiːpɪŋ;

103811|25-000021|In fact, however, the two ladies had met, in Washington Square, without tears, and when they found themselves alone together a certain dryness fell upon the girl's emotion.|ɪn fakt, haʊɛvə, ðə tuː leɪdiz had mɛt, ɪn wɒʃɪŋtən skweə, wɪðaʊt tiəz, and wɛn ðeɪ faʊnd ðɛmsɛlvz ɐləʊn təɡɛðə eɪ sɜːtən dɹaɪnəs fɛl əpɒn ðə ɡɜːlz ɪməʊʃən.
103812|25-000022|It came over her with a greater force that misess Penniman had enjoyed a whole year of her lover's society, and it was not a pleasure to her to hear her aunt explain and interpret the young man, speaking of him as if her own knowledge of him were supreme.|ɪt keɪm əʊvə hɜː wɪð eɪ ɡɹeɪtə fɔːs ðat mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had ɛndʒɔɪd eɪ həʊl jiə ɒv hɜː lʌvəz səsaɪəti, and ɪt wɒz nɒt eɪ plɛʒə tuː hɜː tuː hiə hɜː ant ɛkspleɪn and ɪntɜːpɹɪt ðə jʌŋ man, spiːkɪŋ ɒv hɪm az ɪf hɜː əʊn nɒlɪdʒ ɒv hɪm wɜː suːpɹiːm.
103813|25-000023|It was not that Catherine was jealous;|ɪt wɒz nɒt ðat kaθɹɪn wɒz dʒɛləs;
103814|25-000024|but her sense of misess Penniman's innocent falsity, which had lain dormant, began to haunt her again, and she was glad that she was safely at home.|bʌt hɜː sɛns ɒv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz ɪnəsənt fɒlsɪti, wɪtʃ had leɪn dɔːmənt, bɪɡan tuː hɔːnt hɜː ɐɡɛn, and ʃiː wɒz ɡlad ðat ʃiː wɒz seɪfli at həʊm.
103815|25-000025|With this, however, it was a blessing to be able to talk of Morris, to sound his name, to be with a person who was not unjust to him.|wɪð ðɪs, haʊɛvə, ɪt wɒz eɪ blɛsɪŋ tuː biː eɪbəl tuː tɔːk ɒv mɒɹɪs, tuː saʊnd hɪz neɪm, tuː biː wɪð eɪ pɜːsən huː wɒz nɒt ʌndʒʌst tuː hɪm.
103816|25-000026|"You have been very kind to him," said Catherine.| "juː hav biːn vɛɹi kaɪnd tuː hɪm," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
103817|25-000027|He has written me that, often.|hiː haz ɹɪtən miː ðat, ɒfən.
103818|25-000028|I shall never forget that, Aunt Lavinia.|aɪ ʃal nɛvə fəɡɛt ðat, ant lavɪniə.
103819|25-000029|I have done what I could;|aɪ hav dʌn wɒt aɪ kʊd;
103820|25-000030|it has been very little.|ɪt haz biːn vɛɹi lɪtəl.

103822|25-000032|Your Aunt Almond thought it was too much, and used to scold me terribly;|jɔː ant ɒlmənd θɔːt ɪt wɒz tuː mʌtʃ, and juːzd tuː skəʊld miː tɛɹɪbli;
103823|25-000033|but she promised me, at least, not to betray me.|bʌt ʃiː pɹɒmɪst miː, at liːst, nɒt tuː bɪtɹeɪ miː.
103825|25-000035|Not to tell your father.|nɒt tuː tɛl jɔː fɑːðə.
103826|25-000036|"He used to sit in your father's study!" said misess Penniman, with a little laugh.| "hiː juːzd tuː sɪt ɪn jɔː fɑːðəz stʌdi!" sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, wɪð eɪ lɪtəl laf.
103827|25-000037|Catherine was silent a moment.|kaθɹɪn wɒz saɪlənt eɪ məʊmənt.
103828|25-000038|This idea was disagreeable to her, and she was reminded again, with pain, of her aunt's secretive habits.|ðɪs aɪdiə wɒz dɪsɐɡɹiːəbəl tuː hɜː, and ʃiː wɒz ɹɪmaɪndɪd ɐɡɛn, wɪð peɪn, ɒv hɜː ants siːkɹətɪv habɪts.
103829|25-000039|Morris, the reader may be informed, had had the tact not to tell her that he sat in her father's study.|mɒɹɪs, ðə ɹiːdə meɪ biː ɪnfɔːmd, had had ðə takt nɒt tuː tɛl hɜː ðat hiː sat ɪn hɜː fɑːðəz stʌdi.
103830|25-000040|He had known her but for a few months, and her aunt had known her for fifteen years;|hiː had nəʊn hɜː bʌt fɔː eɪ fjuː mʌnθs, and hɜː ant had nəʊn hɜː fɔː fɪftiːn jiəz;
103832|25-000042|"I am sorry you made him go into father's room," she said, after a while.| "aɪ am sɒɹi juː meɪd hɪm ɡəʊ ɪntʊ fɑːðəz ɹuːm," ʃiː sɛd, aftə eɪ waɪl.
103833|25-000043|I didn't make him go;|aɪ dɪdnt meɪk hɪm ɡəʊ;
103834|25-000044|he went himself.|hiː wɛnt hɪmsɛlf.
103835|25-000045|He liked to look at the books, and all those things in the glass cases.|hiː laɪkt tuː lʊk at ðə bʊks, and ɔːl ðəʊz θɪŋz ɪn ðə ɡlas keɪsɪz.

103838|25-000048|Catherine was silent again;|kaθɹɪn wɒz saɪlənt ɐɡɛn;
103839|25-000049|then, "I wish he had found some employment," she said.|ðɛn, "aɪ wɪʃ hiː had faʊnd sʌm ɛmplɔɪmənt," ʃiː sɛd.
103840|25-000050|He has found some employment!|hiː haz faʊnd sʌm ɛmplɔɪmənt!
103841|25-000051|It's beautiful news, and he told me to tell you as soon as you arrived.|ɪts bjuːtifəl njuːz, and hiː təʊld miː tuː tɛl juː az suːn az juː ɐɹaɪvd.

103844|25-000054|This seemed to Catherine indeed beautiful news;|ðɪs siːmd tuː kaθɹɪn ɪndiːd bjuːtifəl njuːz;
103845|25-000055|it had a fine prosperous air.|ɪt had eɪ faɪn pɹɒspəɹəs eə.

103847|25-000057|and now, for a moment, she was disposed to throw herself on Aunt Lavinia's neck.|and naʊ, fɔː eɪ məʊmənt, ʃiː wɒz dɪspəʊzd tuː θɹəʊ hɜːsɛlf ɒn ant lavɪniəz nɛk.
103848|25-000058|It's much better than being under some one;|ɪts mʌtʃ bɛtə ðɐn biːɪŋ ʌndə sʌm wɒn;
103849|25-000059|"and he has never been used to that," misess Penniman went on.| "and hiː haz nɛvə biːn juːzd tuː ðat," mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɛnt ɒn.
103850|25-000060|He is just as good as his partner -- they are perfectly equal!|hiː ɪz dʒʌst az ɡʊd az hɪz pɑːtnə -- ðeɪ ɑː pɜːfɛktlɪ iːkwəl!

103852|25-000062|I should like to know what your father can say now!|aɪ ʃʊd laɪk tuː nəʊ wɒt jɔː fɑːðə kan seɪ naʊ!
103853|25-000063|They have got an office in Duane Street, and little printed cards;|ðeɪ hav ɡɒt an ɒfɪs ɪn dweɪn stɹiːt, and lɪtəl pɹɪntɪd kɑːdz;
103854|25-000064|he brought me one to show me.|hiː bɹɔːt miː wɒn tuː ʃəʊ miː.

103856|25-000066|That's what he said to me the last time he was here -- 'You see how right I was to wait!' He has got other people under him, instead of being a subordinate.|ðats wɒt hiː sɛd tuː miː ðə last taɪm hiː wɒz hiə -- 'juː siː haʊ ɹaɪt aɪ wɒz tuː weɪt! hiː haz ɡɒt ʌðə piːpəl ʌndə hɪm, ɪnstɛd ɒv biːɪŋ eɪ sʌbɔːdɪnət.
103857|25-000067|He could never be a subordinate;|hiː kʊd nɛvə biː eɪ sʌbɔːdɪnət;
103858|25-000068|I have often told him I could never think of him in that way.|aɪ hav ɒfən təʊld hɪm aɪ kʊd nɛvə θɪŋk ɒv hɪm ɪn ðat weɪ.
103859|25-000069|Catherine assented to this proposition, and was very happy to know that Morris was his own master;|kaθɹɪn ɐsɛntɪd tuː ðɪs pɹɒpəzɪʃən, and wɒz vɛɹi hapi tuː nəʊ ðat mɒɹɪs wɒz hɪz əʊn mastə;
103860|25-000070|but she was deprived of the satisfaction of thinking that she might communicate this news in triumph to her father.|bʌt ʃiː wɒz dɪpɹaɪvd ɒv ðə satɪsfakʃən ɒv θɪŋkɪŋ ðat ʃiː maɪt kəmjuːnɪkeɪt ðɪs njuːz ɪn tɹaɪʌmf tuː hɜː fɑːðə.
103861|25-000071|Her father would care equally little whether Morris were established in business or transported for life.|hɜː fɑːðə wʊd keə iːkwəli lɪtəl wɛðə mɒɹɪs wɜː ɪstablɪʃt ɪn bɪznəs ɔː tɹanspɔːtɪd fɔː laɪf.
103862|25-000072|Her trunks had been brought into her room, and further reference to her lover was for a short time suspended, while she opened them and displayed to her aunt some of the spoils of foreign travel.|hɜː tɹʌŋks had biːn bɹɔːt ɪntʊ hɜː ɹuːm, and fɜːðə ɹɛfɹəns tuː hɜː lʌvə wɒz fɔː eɪ ʃɔːt taɪm səspɛndɪd, waɪl ʃiː əʊpənd ðɛm and dɪspleɪd tuː hɜː ant sʌm ɒv ðə spɔɪlz ɒv fɒɹən tɹavəl.
103863|25-000073|These were rich and abundant;|ðiːz wɜː ɹɪtʃ and ɐbʌndənt;
103864|25-000074|and Catherine had brought home a present to every one -- to every one save Morris, to whom she had brought simply her undiverted heart.|and kaθɹɪn had bɹɔːt həʊm eɪ pɹɛzənt tuː ɛvɹɪ wɒn -- tuː ɛvɹɪ wɒn seɪv mɒɹɪs, tuː huːm ʃiː had bɹɔːt sɪmpli hɜː ʌndaɪvɜːtɪd hɑːt.
103865|25-000075|To misess Penniman she had been lavishly generous, and Aunt Lavinia spent half an hour in unfolding and folding again, with little ejaculations of gratitude and taste.|tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ʃiː had biːn lavɪʃli dʒɛnəɹəs, and ant lavɪniə spɛnt hɑːf an aʊə ɪn ʌnfəʊldɪŋ and fəʊldɪŋ ɐɡɛn, wɪð lɪtəl ɪdʒakjʊleɪʃənz ɒv ɡɹatɪtjuːd and teɪst.

103870|25-000080|And draped in her shawl, she stood there smiling.|and dɹeɪpt ɪn hɜː ʃɔːl, ʃiː stʊd ðeə smaɪlɪŋ.
103871|25-000081|"You had better wait till she comes," said Catherine.| "juː had bɛtə weɪt tɪl ʃiː kʌmz," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
103873|25-000083|Catherine, are you changed?|kaθɹɪn, ɑː juː tʃeɪndʒd?

103878|25-000088|Then, "How is your father?" she asked in a moment, with her eyes on her niece.|ðɛn, "haʊ ɪz jɔː fɑːðə?" ʃiː askt ɪn eɪ məʊmənt, wɪð hɜː aɪz ɒn hɜː niːs.

103920|25-000130|Her aunt had never seen her with just this manner, and misess Penniman, observing her, set it down to foreign travel, which had made her more positive, more mature.|hɜː ant had nɛvə siːn hɜː wɪð dʒʌst ðɪs manə, and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, ɒbzɜːvɪŋ hɜː, sɛt ɪt daʊn tuː fɒɹən tɹavəl, wɪtʃ had meɪd hɜː mɔː pɒzɪtɪv, mɔː mətʃʊə.

103924|25-000134|While she was engaged in this speculation, Catherine broke out, with a certain sharpness, "Why are you so contradictory, Aunt Penniman?"|waɪl ʃiː wɒz ɛŋɡeɪdʒd ɪn ðɪs spɛkjʊleɪʃən, kaθɹɪn bɹəʊk aʊt, wɪð eɪ sɜːtən ʃɑːpnəs, "waɪ ɑː juː səʊ kɒntɹədɪktəɹi, ant pɛnɪmən?"
103925|25-000135|You seem to think one thing at one time, and another at another.|juː siːm tuː θɪŋk wɒn θɪŋ at wɒn taɪm, and ɐnʌðə at ɐnʌðə.
103926|25-000136|A year ago, before I went away, you wished me not to mind about displeasing father;|eɪ jiə ɐɡəʊ, bɪfɔː aɪ wɛnt ɐweɪ, juː wɪʃt miː nɒt tuː maɪnd ɐbaʊt dɪspliːzɪŋ fɑːðə;
103927|25-000137|and now you seem to recommend me to take another line.|and naʊ juː siːm tuː ɹɛkəmɛnd miː tuː teɪk ɐnʌðə laɪn.
103928|25-000138|You change about so.|juː tʃeɪndʒ ɐbaʊt səʊ.
103929|25-000139|This attack was unexpected, for misess Penniman was not used, in any discussion, to seeing the war carried into her own country -- possibly because the enemy generally had doubts of finding subsistence there.|ðɪs ɐtak wɒz ʌnɛkspɛktɪd, fɔː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz nɒt juːzd, ɪn ɛni dɪskʌʃən, tuː siːɪŋ ðə wɔː kaɹid ɪntʊ hɜː əʊn kʌntɹi -- pɒsɪbli bɪkɒz ðə ɛnəmi dʒɛnəɹəli had daʊts ɒv faɪndɪŋ sʌbsɪstəns ðeə.
103930|25-000140|To her own consciousness, the flowery fields of her reason had rarely been ravaged by a hostile force.|tuː hɜː əʊn kɒnʃəsnəs, ðə flaʊəɹi fiːldz ɒv hɜː ɹiːzən had ɹeəli biːn ɹavɪdʒd baɪ eɪ hɒstaɪl fɔːs.
103931|25-000141|It was perhaps on this account that in defending them she was majestic rather than agile.|ɪt wɒz pəhaps ɒn ðɪs ɐkaʊnt ðat ɪn dɪfɛndɪŋ ðɛm ʃiː wɒz mɐdʒɛstɪk ɹɑːðə ðɐn adʒaɪl.
103932|25-000142|I don't know what you accuse me of, save of being too deeply interested in your happiness.|aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ wɒt juː ɐkjuːz miː ɒv, seɪv ɒv biːɪŋ tuː diːpli ɪntɹɪstɪd ɪn jɔː hapɪnəs.
103933|25-000143|It is the first time I have been told I am capricious.|ɪt ɪz ðə fɜːst taɪm aɪ hav biːn təʊld aɪ am kɐpɹɪʃəs.
103934|25-000144|That fault is not what I am usually reproached with.|ðat fɒlt ɪz nɒt wɒt aɪ am juːʒuːəli ɹɪpɹəʊtʃt wɪð.
103935|25-000145|You were angry last year that I wouldn't marry immediately, and now you talk about my winning my father over.|juː wɜː aŋɡɹi last jiə ðat aɪ wʊdnt maɹi ɪmiːdɪətli, and naʊ juː tɔːk ɐbaʊt maɪ wɪnɪŋ maɪ fɑːðə əʊvə.
103937|25-000147|Well, he has taken me for nothing, and you ought to be satisfied.|wɛl, hiː haz teɪkən miː fɔː nʌθɪŋ, and juː ɔːt tuː biː satɪsfaɪd.
103938|25-000148|Nothing is changed -- nothing but my feeling about father.|nʌθɪŋ ɪz tʃeɪndʒd -- nʌθɪŋ bʌt maɪ fiːlɪŋ ɐbaʊt fɑːðə.
103939|25-000149|I don't mind nearly so much now.|aɪ dəʊnt maɪnd niəli səʊ mʌtʃ naʊ.
103940|25-000150|I have been as good as I could, but he doesn't care.|aɪ hav biːn az ɡʊd az aɪ kʊd, bʌt hiː dʌzənt keə.
103941|25-000151|Now I don't care either.|naʊ aɪ dəʊnt keə aɪðə.
103942|25-000152|I don't know whether I have grown bad;|aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ wɛðə aɪ hav ɡɹəʊn bad;
103943|25-000153|perhaps I have.|pəhaps aɪ hav.
103944|25-000154|But I don't care for that.|bʌt aɪ dəʊnt keə fɔː ðat.
103945|25-000155|I have come home to be married -- that's all I know.|aɪ hav kʌm həʊm tuː biː maɹid -- ðats ɔːl aɪ nəʊ.
103946|25-000156|That ought to please you, unless you have taken up some new idea;|ðat ɔːt tuː pliːz juː, ʌnlɛs juː hav teɪkən ʌp sʌm njuː aɪdiə;
103947|25-000157|you are so strange.|juː ɑː səʊ stɹeɪndʒ.
103949|25-000159|but you must never speak to me again about pleading with father.|bʌt juː mʌst nɛvə spiːk tuː miː ɐɡɛn ɐbaʊt pliːdɪŋ wɪð fɑːðə.
103950|25-000160|I shall never plead with him for anything;|aɪ ʃal nɛvə pliːd wɪð hɪm fɔː ɛnɪθɪŋ;
103951|25-000161|that is all over.|ðat ɪz ɔːl əʊvə.
103952|25-000162|He has put me off.|hiː haz pʊt miː ɒf.
103953|25-000163|I am come home to be married.|aɪ am kʌm həʊm tuː biː maɹid.
103954|25-000164|This was a more authoritative speech than she had ever heard on her niece's lips, and misess Penniman was proportionately startled.|ðɪs wɒz eɪ mɔː ɔːθɒɹɪtətɪv spiːtʃ ðɐn ʃiː had ɛvə hɜːd ɒn hɜː niːsɪz lɪps, and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz pɹəpɔːʃənətli stɑːtəld.
103955|25-000165|She was indeed a little awestruck, and the force of the girl's emotion and resolution left her nothing to reply.|ʃiː wɒz ɪndiːd eɪ lɪtəl ɔːstɹʌk, and ðə fɔːs ɒv ðə ɡɜːlz ɪməʊʃən and ɹɛzəluːʃən lɛft hɜː nʌθɪŋ tuː ɹɪplaɪ.
103956|25-000166|She was easily frightened, and she always carried off her discomfiture by a concession;|ʃiː wɒz iːzili fɹaɪtənd, and ʃiː ɔːlweɪz kaɹid ɒf hɜː dɪskʌmfɪtʃə baɪ eɪ kənsɛʃən;
103959|26-000003|He came in the afternoon;|hiː keɪm ɪn ðə aftənuːn;
103960|26-000004|but, as may be imagined, he was not on this occasion made free of doctor Sloper's study.|bʌt, az meɪ biː ɪmadʒɪnd, hiː wɒz nɒt ɒn ðɪs əkeɪʒən meɪd fɹiː ɒv dɒktə sləʊpəz stʌdi.
103961|26-000005|He had been coming and going, for the past year, so comfortably and irresponsibly, that he had a certain sense of being wronged by finding himself reminded that he must now limit his horizon to the front parlour, which was Catherine's particular province.|hiː had biːn kʌmɪŋ and ɡəʊɪŋ, fɔː ðə past jiə, səʊ kʌmftəbli and ɪɹɪspɒnsɪbli, ðat hiː had eɪ sɜːtən sɛns ɒv biːɪŋ ɹɒŋd baɪ faɪndɪŋ hɪmsɛlf ɹɪmaɪndɪd ðat hiː mʌst naʊ lɪmɪt hɪz həɹaɪzən tuː ðə fɹʌnt pɑːlə, wɪtʃ wɒz kaθɹɪnz pətɪkjʊlə pɹɒvɪns.
103962|26-000006|"I am very glad you have come back," he said;| "aɪ am vɛɹi ɡlad juː hav kʌm bak," hiː sɛd;
103963|26-000007|it makes me very happy to see you again.|ɪt meɪks miː vɛɹi hapi tuː siː juː ɐɡɛn.
103964|26-000008|And he looked at her, smiling, from head to foot;|and hiː lʊkt at hɜː, smaɪlɪŋ, fɹɒm hɛd tuː fʊt;
103965|26-000009|though it did not appear, afterwards, that he agreed with misess Penniman (who, womanlike, went more into details) in thinking her embellished.|ðəʊ ɪt dɪd nɒt ɐpiə, aftəwədz, ðat hiː ɐɡɹiːd wɪð mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən (huː, wʊmənlaɪk, wɛnt mɔː ɪntʊ diːteɪlz) ɪn θɪŋkɪŋ hɜː ɛmbɛlɪʃt.
103966|26-000010|To Catherine he appeared resplendent;|tuː kaθɹɪn hiː ɐpiəd ɹɪsplɛndənt;
103967|26-000011|it was some time before she could believe again that this beautiful young man was her own exclusive property.|ɪt wɒz sʌm taɪm bɪfɔː ʃiː kʊd bɪliːv ɐɡɛn ðat ðɪs bjuːtifəl jʌŋ man wɒz hɜː əʊn ɛkskluːsɪv pɹɒpəti.
103968|26-000012|They had a great deal of characteristic lovers' talk -- a soft exchange of inquiries and assurances.|ðeɪ had eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl ɒv kaɹɪktəɹɪstɪk lʌvəz tɔːk -- eɪ sɒft ɛkstʃeɪndʒ ɒv ɪŋkwaɪəɹiz and əʃʊəɹənsɪz.
103969|26-000013|In these matters Morris had an excellent grace, which flung a picturesque interest even over the account of his debut in the commission business -- a subject as to which his companion earnestly questioned him.|ɪn ðiːz matəz mɒɹɪs had an ɛksələnt ɡɹeɪs, wɪtʃ flʌŋ eɪ pɪktʃəɹɛsk ɪntɹɪst iːvən əʊvə ðə ɐkaʊnt ɒv hɪz deɪbjuː ɪn ðə kəmɪʃən bɪznəs -- eɪ sʌbdʒɛkt az tuː wɪtʃ hɪz kəmpaniən ɜːnɪstli kwɛstʃənd hɪm.
103970|26-000014|From time to time he got up from the sofa where they sat together, and walked about the room;|fɹɒm taɪm tuː taɪm hiː ɡɒt ʌp fɹɒm ðə səʊfə weə ðeɪ sat təɡɛðə, and wɔːkt ɐbaʊt ðə ɹuːm;
103971|26-000015|after which he came back, smiling and passing his hand through his hair.|aftə wɪtʃ hiː keɪm bak, smaɪlɪŋ and pasɪŋ hɪz hand θɹuː hɪz heə.
103972|26-000016|He was unquiet, as was natural in a young man who has just been reunited to a long-absent mistress, and Catherine made the reflexion that she had never seen him so excited.|hiː wɒz ʌŋkwaɪət, az wɒz natʃəɹəl ɪn eɪ jʌŋ man huː haz dʒʌst biːn ɹiːjuːnaɪtɪd tuː eɪ lɒŋɡabsənt mɪstɹəs, and kaθɹɪn meɪd ðə ɹiːflɛksiən ðat ʃiː had nɛvə siːn hɪm səʊ ɛksaɪtɪd.
103973|26-000017|It gave her pleasure, somehow, to note this fact.|ɪt ɡeɪv hɜː plɛʒə, sʌmhaʊ, tuː nəʊt ðɪs fakt.
103975|26-000019|But for the moment she was so happy, so lifted up by the belief that her troubles at last were over, that she forgot to be ashamed of her meagre answers.|bʌt fɔː ðə məʊmənt ʃiː wɒz səʊ hapi, səʊ lɪftɪd ʌp baɪ ðə bɪliːf ðat hɜː tɹʌbəlz at last wɜː əʊvə, ðat ʃiː fəɡɒt tuː biː ɐʃeɪmd ɒv hɜː miːɡə ansəz.
103976|26-000020|It seemed to her now that she could marry him without the remnant of a scruple or a single tremor save those that belonged to joy.|ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː naʊ ðat ʃiː kʊd maɹi hɪm wɪðaʊt ðə ɹɛmnənt ɒv eɪ skɹuːpəl ɔː eɪ sɪŋɡəl tɹɛmə seɪv ðəʊz ðat bɪlɒŋd tuː dʒɔɪ.
103977|26-000021|Without waiting for him to ask, she told him that her father had come back in exactly the same state of mind -- that he had not yielded an inch.|wɪðaʊt weɪtɪŋ fɔː hɪm tuː ask, ʃiː təʊld hɪm ðat hɜː fɑːðə had kʌm bak ɪn ɛɡzaktli ðə seɪm steɪt ɒv maɪnd -- ðat hiː had nɒt jiːldɪd an ɪntʃ.

103979|26-000023|Morris sat looking and smiling.|mɒɹɪs sat lʊkɪŋ and smaɪlɪŋ.
103980|26-000024|"My poor dear girl!" he exclaimed.| "maɪ pʊə diə ɡɜːl!" hiː ɛkskleɪmd.
103981|26-000025|"You mustn't pity me," said Catherine;| "juː mʌstnt pɪti miː," sɛd kaθɹɪn;
103982|26-000026|I don't mind it now -- I am used to it.|aɪ dəʊnt maɪnd ɪt naʊ -- aɪ am juːzd tuː ɪt.
103983|26-000027|Morris continued to smile, and then he got up and walked about again.|mɒɹɪs kəntɪnjuːd tuː smaɪl, and ðɛn hiː ɡɒt ʌp and wɔːkt ɐbaʊt ɐɡɛn.
103984|26-000028|You had better let me try him!|juː had bɛtə lɛt miː tɹaɪ hɪm!

103986|26-000030|"You would only make him worse," Catherine answered resolutely.| "juː wʊd əʊnli meɪk hɪm wɜːs," kaθɹɪn ansəd ɹɛzəluːtli.
103987|26-000031|You say that because I managed it so badly before.|juː seɪ ðat bɪkɒz aɪ manɪdʒd ɪt səʊ badli bɪfɔː.

103997|26-000041|Of course, I am not beaten on the main issue;|ɒv kɔːs, aɪ am nɒt biːtən ɒn ðə meɪn ɪʃuː;

104014|26-000058|and there was a certain mild, sad firmness in her tone which he heard for the first time.|and ðeə wɒz eɪ sɜːtən maɪld, sad fɜːmnəs ɪn hɜː təʊn wɪtʃ hiː hɜːd fɔː ðə fɜːst taɪm.

104043|26-000087|and it's a stronger reason for his never being reconciled than simply his dislike for you.|and ɪts eɪ stɹɒŋɡə ɹiːzən fɔː hɪz nɛvə biːɪŋ ɹɛkənsaɪld ðɐn sɪmpli hɪz dɪslaɪk fɔː juː.
104044|26-000088|"'Simply?'" cried Morris, with a laugh, "I am much obliged for that!"| "'sɪmpli?" kɹaɪd mɒɹɪs, wɪð eɪ laf, "aɪ am mʌtʃ əblaɪdʒd fɔː ðat!"
104045|26-000089|I don't mind about his disliking you now;|aɪ dəʊnt maɪnd ɐbaʊt hɪz dɪslaɪkɪŋ juː naʊ;
104046|26-000090|I mind everything less.|aɪ maɪnd ɛvɹɪθɪŋ lɛs.
104047|26-000091|I feel differently;|aɪ fiːl dɪfɹəntli;
104048|26-000092|I feel separated from my father.|aɪ fiːl sɛpəɹeɪtɪd fɹɒm maɪ fɑːðə.
104049|26-000093|"Upon my word," said Morris, "you are a queer family!"| "əpɒn maɪ wɜːd," sɛd mɒɹɪs, "juː ɑː eɪ kwiə famɪli!"
104050|26-000094|"Don't say that -- don't say anything unkind," the girl entreated.| "dəʊnt seɪ ðat -- dəʊnt seɪ ɛnɪθɪŋ ʌŋkaɪnd," ðə ɡɜːl ɛntɹiːtɪd.
104051|26-000095|"You must be very kind to me now, because, Morris -- because," and she hesitated a moment -- "because I have done a great deal for you."| "juː mʌst biː vɛɹi kaɪnd tuː miː naʊ, bɪkɒz, mɒɹɪs -- bɪkɒz," and ʃiː hɛzɪteɪtɪd eɪ məʊmənt -- "bɪkɒz aɪ hav dʌn eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl fɔː juː."
104052|26-000096|Oh, I know that, my dear!|əʊ, aɪ nəʊ ðat, maɪ diə!
104053|26-000097|She had spoken up to this moment without vehemence or outward sign of emotion, gently, reasoningly, only trying to explain.|ʃiː had spəʊkən ʌp tuː ðɪs məʊmənt wɪðaʊt viəməns ɔː aʊtwəd saɪn ɒv ɪməʊʃən, dʒɛntli, ɹiːzənɪŋli, əʊnli tɹaɪɪŋ tuː ɛkspleɪn.
104054|26-000098|But her emotion had been ineffectually smothered, and it betrayed itself at last in the trembling of her voice.|bʌt hɜː ɪməʊʃən had biːn ɪnɪfɛktʃuːəli smʌðəd, and ɪt bɪtɹeɪd ɪtsɛlf at last ɪn ðə tɹɛmblɪŋ ɒv hɜː vɔɪs.
104056|26-000100|It has made me very unhappy;|ɪt haz meɪd miː vɛɹi ʌnhapi;
104057|26-000101|or it would have made me so if I didn't love you.|ɔː ɪt wʊd hav meɪd miː səʊ ɪf aɪ dɪdnt lʌv juː.
104058|26-000102|You can tell when a person speaks to you as if -- as if|juː kan tɛl wɛn eɪ pɜːsən spiːks tuː juː az ɪf -- az ɪf
104059|26-000103|As if what?|az ɪf wɒt?
104060|26-000104|"As if they despised you!" said Catherine passionately.| "az ɪf ðeɪ dɪspaɪzd juː!" sɛd kaθɹɪn paʃənətli.
104061|26-000105|He spoke that way the night before we sailed.|hiː spəʊk ðat weɪ ðə naɪt bɪfɔː wiː seɪld.
104062|26-000106|It wasn't much, but it was enough, and I thought of it on the voyage, all the time.|ɪt wɒsnt mʌtʃ, bʌt ɪt wɒz ɪnʌf, and aɪ θɔːt ɒv ɪt ɒn ðə vɔɪɪdʒ, ɔːl ðə taɪm.
104063|26-000107|Then I made up my mind.|ðɛn aɪ meɪd ʌp maɪ maɪnd.
104064|26-000108|I will never ask him for anything again, or expect anything from him.|aɪ wɪl nɛvə ask hɪm fɔː ɛnɪθɪŋ ɐɡɛn, ɔː ɛkspɛkt ɛnɪθɪŋ fɹɒm hɪm.
104065|26-000109|It would not be natural now.|ɪt wʊd nɒt biː natʃəɹəl naʊ.
104066|26-000110|We must be very happy together, and we must not seem to depend upon his forgiveness.|wiː mʌst biː vɛɹi hapi təɡɛðə, and wiː mʌst nɒt siːm tuː dɪpɛnd əpɒn hɪz fəɡɪvnəs.
104068|26-000112|This was an easy promise to make, and Morris made it with fine effect.|ðɪs wɒz an iːzi pɹɒmɪs tuː meɪk, and mɒɹɪs meɪd ɪt wɪð faɪn ɪfɛkt.
104069|27-000001|the Doctor, of course, on his return, had a good deal of talk with his sisters.|ðə dɒktə, ɒv kɔːs, ɒn hɪz ɹɪtɜːn, had eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv tɔːk wɪð hɪz sɪstəz.
104070|27-000002|He was at no great pains to narrate his travels or to communicate his impressions of distant lands to misess Penniman, upon whom he contented himself with bestowing a memento of his enviable experience, in the shape of a velvet gown.|hiː wɒz at nəʊ ɡɹeɪt peɪnz tuː nɐɹeɪt hɪz tɹavəlz ɔː tuː kəmjuːnɪkeɪt hɪz ɪmpɹɛʃənz ɒv dɪstənt landz tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, əpɒn huːm hiː kəntɛntɪd hɪmsɛlf wɪð bɪstəʊɪŋ eɪ məmɛntəʊ ɒv hɪz ɛnviəbəl ɛkspiəɹɪəns, ɪn ðə ʃeɪp ɒv eɪ vɛlvɪt ɡaʊn.
104071|27-000003|But he conversed with her at some length about matters nearer home, and lost no time in assuring her that he was still an inflexible father.|bʌt hiː kənvɜːst wɪð hɜː at sʌm lɛŋθ ɐbaʊt matəz niəɹə həʊm, and lɒst nəʊ taɪm ɪn əʃʊəɹɪŋ hɜː ðat hiː wɒz stɪl an ɪnflɛksɪbəl fɑːðə.
104073|27-000005|I don't ask you, and you needn't deny it.|aɪ dəʊnt ask juː, and juː niːdnt dɪnaɪ ɪt.
104075|27-000007|No one has betrayed you, and there has been no spy upon your proceedings.|nəʊ wɒn haz bɪtɹeɪd juː, and ðeə haz biːn nəʊ spaɪ əpɒn jɔː pɹəsiːdɪŋz.
104076|27-000008|Elizabeth has told no tales, and has never mentioned you except to praise your good looks and good spirits.|ɪlɪzəbəθ haz təʊld nəʊ teɪlz, and haz nɛvə mɛnʃənd juː ɛksɛpt tuː pɹeɪz jɔː ɡʊd lʊks and ɡʊd spɪɹɪts.
104077|27-000009|The thing is simply an inference of my own -- an induction, as the philosophers say.|ðə θɪŋ ɪz sɪmpli an ɪnfəɹəns ɒv maɪ əʊn -- an ɪndʌkʃən, az ðə fɪlɒsəfəz seɪ.
104079|27-000011|mister Townsend has been a good deal in the house;|mɪstə taʊnsɛnd haz biːn eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɪn ðə haʊs;
104080|27-000012|there is something in the house that tells me so.|ðeə ɪz sʌmθɪŋ ɪn ðə haʊs ðat tɛlz miː səʊ.
104082|27-000014|I don't grudge him the comfort of it;|aɪ dəʊnt ɡɹʌdʒ hɪm ðə kʌmfət ɒv ɪt;
104083|27-000015|it is the only one he will ever enjoy at my expense.|ɪt ɪz ðə əʊnli wɒn hiː wɪl ɛvə ɛndʒɔɪ at maɪ ɛkspɛns.
104084|27-000016|It seems likely, indeed, that I shall be able to economise at his own.|ɪt siːmz laɪkli, ɪndiːd, ðat aɪ ʃal biː eɪbəl tuː ɪkɒnəmaɪz at hɪz əʊn.

104086|27-000018|but I should like you to know that if you have encouraged him to believe that he will gain anything by hanging on, or that I have budged a hair's-breadth from the position I took up a year ago, you have played him a trick for which he may exact reparation.|bʌt aɪ ʃʊd laɪk juː tuː nəʊ ðat ɪf juː hav ɛŋkʌɹɪdʒd hɪm tuː bɪliːv ðat hiː wɪl ɡeɪn ɛnɪθɪŋ baɪ haŋɪŋ ɒn, ɔː ðat aɪ hav bʌdʒd eɪ heəsbɹɛdθ fɹɒm ðə pəzɪʃən aɪ tʊk ʌp eɪ jiə ɐɡəʊ, juː hav pleɪd hɪm eɪ tɹɪk fɔː wɪtʃ hiː meɪ ɛɡzakt ɹɪpɐɹeɪʃən.

104088|27-000020|Of course you have done it conscientiously;|ɒv kɔːs juː hav dʌn ɪt kɒnsɪɛnʃəsli;
104089|27-000021|you have made yourself believe that I can be tired out.|juː hav meɪd jɔːsɛlf bɪliːv ðat aɪ kan biː taɪəd aʊt.
104090|27-000022|This is the most baseless hallucination that ever visited the brain of a genial optimist.|ðɪs ɪz ðə məʊst beɪsləs hɐluːsɪneɪʃən ðat ɛvə vɪzɪtɪd ðə bɹeɪn ɒv eɪ dʒiːnɪəl ɒptɪmɪst.

104094|27-000026|Catherine appears not to have budged an inch either;|kaθɹɪn ɐpiəz nɒt tuː hav bʌdʒd an ɪntʃ aɪðə;
104095|27-000027|she is equally fresh;|ʃiː ɪz iːkwəli fɹɛʃ;

104099|27-000031|Take it to heart, dear Lavinia.|teɪk ɪt tuː hɑːt, diə lavɪniə.

104101|27-000033|"I can't say I expected it," said misess Penniman.| "aɪ kant seɪ aɪ ɛkspɛktɪd ɪt," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
104102|27-000034|And I had a sort of foolish hope that you would come home without that odious ironical tone with which you treat the most sacred subjects.|and aɪ had eɪ sɔːt ɒv fuːlɪʃ həʊp ðat juː wʊd kʌm həʊm wɪðaʊt ðat əʊdiəs aɪɹɒnɪkəl təʊn wɪð wɪtʃ juː tɹiːt ðə məʊst seɪkɹɪd sʌbdʒɛkts.

104104|27-000036|It is not, however, always necessary, and I will show you how gracefully I can lay it aside.|ɪt ɪz nɒt, haʊɛvə, ɔːlweɪz nɛsɪsəɹi, and aɪ wɪl ʃəʊ juː haʊ ɡɹeɪsfəli aɪ kan leɪ ɪt ɐsaɪd.

104112|27-000044|I call it pugilism.|aɪ kɔːl ɪt pjuːdʒɪlɪzəm.
104113|27-000045|misess Penniman, however, in spite of her pugilism, was a good deal frightened, and she took counsel of her fears.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, haʊɛvə, ɪn spaɪt ɒv hɜː pjuːdʒɪlɪzəm, wɒz eɪ ɡʊd diːl fɹaɪtənd, and ʃiː tʊk kaʊnsəl ɒv hɜː fiəz.
104114|27-000046|Her brother meanwhile took counsel, with many reservations, of misess Almond, to whom he was no less generous than to Lavinia, and a good deal more communicative.|hɜː bɹʌðə miːnwaɪl tʊk kaʊnsəl, wɪð mɛni ɹɛzəveɪʃənz, ɒv mɪsɛs ɒlmənd, tuː huːm hiː wɒz nəʊ lɛs dʒɛnəɹəs ðɐn tuː lavɪniə, and eɪ ɡʊd diːl mɔː kəmjuːnɪkətɪv.

104120|27-000052|But you must admit that your leaving Lavinia quite alone was a great change for her, and that it was natural she should want some society.|bʌt juː mʌst ɐdmɪt ðat jɔː liːvɪŋ lavɪniə kwaɪt ɐləʊn wɒz eɪ ɡɹeɪt tʃeɪndʒ fɔː hɜː, and ðat ɪt wɒz natʃəɹəl ʃiː ʃʊd wɒnt sʌm səsaɪəti.

104123|27-000055|She is capable of telling me that she drank it all herself.|ʃiː ɪz keɪpəbəl ɒv tɛlɪŋ miː ðat ʃiː dɹaŋk ɪt ɔːl hɜːsɛlf.
104124|27-000056|Think of the inconceivable bad taste, in the circumstances, of that fellow making free with the house -- or coming there at all!|θɪŋk ɒv ðə ɪŋkənsiːvəbəl bad teɪst, ɪn ðə sɜːkəmstansɪz, ɒv ðat fɛləʊ meɪkɪŋ fɹiː wɪð ðə haʊs -- ɔː kʌmɪŋ ðeə at ɔːl!

104128|27-000060|It's so much gained.|ɪts səʊ mʌtʃ ɡeɪnd.

104133|27-000065|She has not told me that -- and Lavinia didn't deign.|ʃiː haz nɒt təʊld miː ðat -- and lavɪniə dɪdnt deɪn.
104135|27-000067|Not that it matters, for all that the business amounts to.|nɒt ðat ɪt matəz, fɔː ɔːl ðat ðə bɪznəs ɐmaʊnts tuː.

104137|27-000069|I saw that in the first half minute.|aɪ sɔː ðat ɪn ðə fɜːst hɑːf mɪnɪt.
104138|27-000070|She has come home exactly the same.|ʃiː haz kʌm həʊm ɛɡzaktli ðə seɪm.

104159|27-000091|If she doesn't let go, she will be shaken off -- sent tumbling into the dust!|ɪf ʃiː dʌzənt lɛt ɡəʊ, ʃiː wɪl biː ʃeɪkən ɒf -- sɛnt tʌmblɪŋ ɪntʊ ðə dʌst!

104162|27-000094|And then she will complain of her bruises.|and ðɛn ʃiː wɪl kəmpleɪn ɒv hɜː bɹuːzɪz.
104163|27-000095|"She will never complain," said misess Almond.| "ʃiː wɪl nɛvə kəmpleɪn," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd.
104164|27-000096|That I shall object to even more.|ðat aɪ ʃal ɒbdʒɛkt tuː iːvən mɔː.

104166|27-000098|"If she is to have a fall," said misess Almond, with a gentle laugh, "we must spread as many carpets as we can."| "ɪf ʃiː ɪz tuː hav eɪ fɔːl," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd, wɪð eɪ dʒɛntəl laf, "wiː mʌst spɹɛd az mɛni kɑːpɪts az wiː kan."
104167|27-000099|And she carried out this idea by showing a great deal of motherly kindness to the girl.|and ʃiː kaɹid aʊt ðɪs aɪdiə baɪ ʃəʊɪŋ eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl ɒv mʌðəli kaɪndnəs tuː ðə ɡɜːl.
104168|27-000100|misess Penniman immediately wrote to Morris Townsend.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɪmiːdɪətli ɹəʊt tuː mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
104169|27-000101|The intimacy between these two was by this time consummate, but I must content myself with noting but a few of its features.|ðə ɪntɪməsi bɪtwiːn ðiːz tuː wɒz baɪ ðɪs taɪm kɒnsəmeɪt, bʌt aɪ mʌst kɒntɛnt maɪsɛlf wɪð nəʊtɪŋ bʌt eɪ fjuː ɒv ɪts fiːtʃəz.
104170|27-000102|misess Penniman's own share in it was a singular sentiment, which might have been misinterpreted, but which in itself was not discreditable to the poor lady.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz əʊn ʃeə ɪn ɪt wɒz eɪ sɪŋɡjʊlə sɛntɪmənt, wɪtʃ maɪt hav biːn mɪsɪntɜːpɹɪtɪd, bʌt wɪtʃ ɪn ɪtsɛlf wɒz nɒt dɪskɹɛdɪtəbəl tuː ðə pʊə leɪdi.
104171|27-000103|It was a romantic interest in this attractive and unfortunate young man, and yet it was not such an interest as Catherine might have been jealous of.|ɪt wɒz eɪ ɹəʊmantɪk ɪntɹɪst ɪn ðɪs ɐtɹaktɪv and ʌnfɔːtʃənət jʌŋ man, and jɛt ɪt wɒz nɒt sʌtʃ an ɪntɹɪst az kaθɹɪn maɪt hav biːn dʒɛləs ɒv.
104172|27-000104|misess Penniman had not a particle of jealousy of her niece.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had nɒt eɪ pɑːtɪkəl ɒv dʒɛləsi ɒv hɜː niːs.
104173|27-000105|For herself, she felt as if she were Morris's mother or sister -- a mother or sister of an emotional temperament -- and she had an absorbing desire to make him comfortable and happy.|fɔː hɜːsɛlf, ʃiː fɛlt az ɪf ʃiː wɜː mɒɹɪs mʌðə ɔː sɪstə -- eɪ mʌðə ɔː sɪstə ɒv an ɪməʊʃənəl tɛmpɹəmənt -- and ʃiː had an ɐbsɔːbɪŋ dɪzaɪə tuː meɪk hɪm kʌmftəbəl and hapi.
104174|27-000106|She had striven to do so during the year that her brother left her an open field, and her efforts had been attended with the success that has been pointed out.|ʃiː had stɹɪvən tuː duː səʊ djʊəɹɪŋ ðə jiə ðat hɜː bɹʌðə lɛft hɜː an əʊpən fiːld, and hɜː ɛfəts had biːn ɐtɛndɪd wɪð ðə səksɛs ðat haz biːn pɔɪntɪd aʊt.
104175|27-000107|She had never had a child of her own, and Catherine, whom she had done her best to invest with the importance that would naturally belong to a youthful Penniman, had only partly rewarded her zeal.|ʃiː had nɛvə had eɪ tʃaɪld ɒv hɜː əʊn, and kaθɹɪn, huːm ʃiː had dʌn hɜː bɛst tuː ɪnvɛst wɪð ðə ɪmpɔːtəns ðat wʊd natʃəɹəli bɪlɒŋ tuː eɪ juːθfəl pɛnɪmən, had əʊnli pɑːtli ɹɪwɔːdɪd hɜː ziːl.
104176|27-000108|Catherine, as an object of affection and solicitude, had never had that picturesque charm which (as it seemed to her) would have been a natural attribute of her own progeny.|kaθɹɪn, az an ɒbdʒɛkt ɒv ɐfɛkʃən and səlɪsɪtjuːd, had nɛvə had ðat pɪktʃəɹɛsk tʃɑːm wɪtʃ (az ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː) wʊd hav biːn eɪ natʃəɹəl atɹɪbjuːt ɒv hɜː əʊn pɹɒdʒəni.
104177|27-000109|Even the maternal passion in misess Penniman would have been romantic and factitious, and Catherine was not constituted to inspire a romantic passion.|iːvən ðə mətɜːnəl paʃən ɪn mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wʊd hav biːn ɹəʊmantɪk and faktɪʃəs, and kaθɹɪn wɒz nɒt kɒnstɪtjuːtɪd tuː ɪnspaɪə eɪ ɹəʊmantɪk paʃən.
104178|27-000110|misess Penniman was as fond of her as ever, but she had grown to feel that with Catherine she lacked opportunity.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz az fɒnd ɒv hɜː az ɛvə, bʌt ʃiː had ɡɹəʊn tuː fiːl ðat wɪð kaθɹɪn ʃiː lakt ɒpətjuːnɪti.
104179|27-000111|Sentimentally speaking, therefore, she had (though she had not disinherited her niece) adopted Morris Townsend, who gave her opportunity in abundance.|sɛntɪmɛntəli spiːkɪŋ, ðeəfɔː, ʃiː had (ðəʊ ʃiː had nɒt dɪsɪnhɛɹɪtɪd hɜː niːs) ɐdɒptɪd mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd, huː ɡeɪv hɜː ɒpətjuːnɪti ɪn ɐbʌndəns.
104180|27-000112|She would have been very happy to have a handsome and tyrannical son, and would have taken an extreme interest in his love affairs.|ʃiː wʊd hav biːn vɛɹi hapi tuː hav eɪ handsʌm and tɪɹanɪkəl sʌn, and wʊd hav teɪkən an ɛkstɹiːm ɪntɹɪst ɪn hɪz lʌv ɐfeəz.
104182|27-000114|He had largely abated his deference afterwards, for he economised his resources, but the impression was made, and the young man's very brutality came to have a sort of filial value.|hiː had lɑːdʒli ɐbeɪtɪd hɪz dɛfɹəns aftəwədz, fɔː hiː ɪkɒnəmaɪzd hɪz ɹɪzɔːsɪz, bʌt ðə ɪmpɹɛʃən wɒz meɪd, and ðə jʌŋ manz vɛɹi bɹuːtalɪti keɪm tuː hav eɪ sɔːt ɒv fɪlɪəl valjuː.
104183|27-000115|If misess Penniman had had a son, she would probably have been afraid of him, and at this stage of our narrative she was certainly afraid of Morris Townsend.|ɪf mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had had eɪ sʌn, ʃiː wʊd pɹɒbəbli hav biːn ɐfɹeɪd ɒv hɪm, and at ðɪs steɪdʒ ɒv aʊə naɹətɪv ʃiː wɒz sɜːtənli ɐfɹeɪd ɒv mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
104184|27-000116|This was one of the results of his domestication in Washington Square.|ðɪs wɒz wɒn ɒv ðə ɹɪzʌlts ɒv hɪz dəmɛstɪkeɪʃən ɪn wɒʃɪŋtən skweə.
104185|28-000001|the letter was a word of warning;|ðə lɛtə wɒz eɪ wɜːd ɒv wɔːnɪŋ;

104188|28-000004|but we know that misess Penniman's reflexions were rarely just;|bʌt wiː nəʊ ðat mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz ɹiːflɛksiənz wɜː ɹeəli dʒʌst;
104189|28-000005|and, moreover, she felt that it was not for her to depend on what Catherine might do.|and, mɔːɹəʊvə, ʃiː fɛlt ðat ɪt wɒz nɒt fɔː hɜː tuː dɪpɛnd ɒn wɒt kaθɹɪn maɪt duː.

104192|28-000008|He took note of it, amply;|hiː tʊk nəʊt ɒv ɪt, amplɪ;
104193|28-000009|but he lighted his cigar with it, and he waited, in tranquil confidence that he should receive another.|bʌt hiː laɪtɪd hɪz sɪɡɑː wɪð ɪt, and hiː weɪtɪd, ɪn tɹaŋkwɪl kɒnfɪdəns ðat hiː ʃʊd ɹɪsiːv ɐnʌðə.
104194|28-000010|"His state of mind really freezes my blood," misess Penniman had written, alluding to her brother;| "hɪz steɪt ɒv maɪnd ɹiəlɪ fɹiːzɪz maɪ blʌd," mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had ɹɪtən, ɐluːdɪŋ tuː hɜː bɹʌðə;

104196|28-000012|Nevertheless, she wrote again, expressing herself with the aid of a different figure.|nɛvəðəlɛs, ʃiː ɹəʊt ɐɡɛn, ɛkspɹɛsɪŋ hɜːsɛlf wɪð ðə eɪd ɒv eɪ dɪfɹənt fɪɡə.

104215|28-000031|Tell me what you think of this plan.|tɛl miː wɒt juː θɪŋk ɒv ðɪs plan.
104216|28-000032|I would carry a little reticule, like a woman of the people.|aɪ wʊd kaɹi eɪ lɪtəl ɹɪtɪkjuːl, laɪk eɪ wʊmən ɒv ðə piːpəl.
104217|28-000033|In spite of the suggestion about the reticule, Morris appeared to think poorly of the plan, for he gave misess Penniman no encouragement whatever to visit his office, which he had already represented to her as a place peculiarly and unnaturally difficult to find.|ɪn spaɪt ɒv ðə sədʒɛstʃən ɐbaʊt ðə ɹɪtɪkjuːl, mɒɹɪs ɐpiəd tuː θɪŋk pʊəli ɒv ðə plan, fɔː hiː ɡeɪv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən nəʊ ɛŋkʌɹɪdʒmənt wɒtɛvə tuː vɪzɪt hɪz ɒfɪs, wɪtʃ hiː had ɔːlɹɛdi ɹɛpɹɪzɛntɪd tuː hɜː az eɪ pleɪs pɪkjuːliəli and ʌnnatʃəɹəli dɪfɪkəlt tuː faɪnd.
104219|28-000035|It was no surprise to him, when they met at a street corner, in a region of empty lots and undeveloped pavements (misess Penniman being attired as much as possible like a "woman of the people"), to find that, in spite of her urgency, what she chiefly had to convey to him was the assurance of her sympathy.|ɪt wɒz nəʊ səpɹaɪz tuː hɪm, wɛn ðeɪ mɛt at eɪ stɹiːt kɔːnə, ɪn eɪ ɹiːdʒən ɒv ɛmpti lɒts and ʌndɪvɛləpt peɪvmənts (mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən biːɪŋ ɐtaɪəd az mʌtʃ az pɒsɪbəl laɪk eɪ "wʊmən ɒv ðə piːpəl"), tuː faɪnd ðat, ɪn spaɪt ɒv hɜː ɜːdʒənsi, wɒt ʃiː tʃiːfli had tuː kənveɪ tuː hɪm wɒz ðə əʃʊəɹəns ɒv hɜː sɪmpəθi.
104220|28-000036|Of such assurances, however, he had already a voluminous collection, and it would not have been worth his while to forsake a fruitful avocation merely to hear misess Penniman say, for the thousandth time, that she had made his cause her own.|ɒv sʌtʃ əʃʊəɹənsɪz, haʊɛvə, hiː had ɔːlɹɛdi eɪ vəluːmɪnəs kəlɛkʃən, and ɪt wʊd nɒt hav biːn wɜːθ hɪz waɪl tuː fɔːseɪk eɪ fɹuːtfəl avəkeɪʃən miəli tuː hiə mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən seɪ, fɔː ðə θaʊzəndθ taɪm, ðat ʃiː had meɪd hɪz kɔːz hɜː əʊn.

104223|28-000039|"Oh yes, I know perfectly that he combines the properties of a lump of ice and a red-hot coal," he observed.| "əʊ jɛs, aɪ nəʊ pɜːfɛktlɪ ðat hiː kəmbaɪnz ðə pɹɒpətiz ɒv eɪ lʌmp ɒv aɪs and eɪ ɹɛdhɒt kəʊl," hiː ɒbzɜːvd.

104229|28-000045|misess Penniman at this point had an inspiration.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən at ðɪs pɔɪnt had an ɪnspəɹeɪʃən.
104230|28-000046|Couldn't you bring a lawsuit against him?|kʊdnt juː bɹɪŋ eɪ lɔːsuːt ɐɡɛnst hɪm?
104231|28-000047|She wondered that this simple expedient had never occurred to her before.|ʃiː wʌndəd ðat ðɪs sɪmpəl ɛkspiːdiənt had nɛvə əkɜːd tuː hɜː bɪfɔː.
104232|28-000048|"I will bring a lawsuit against you," said Morris, "if you ask me any more such aggravating questions."| "aɪ wɪl bɹɪŋ eɪ lɔːsuːt ɐɡɛnst juː," sɛd mɒɹɪs, "ɪf juː ask miː ɛni mɔː sʌtʃ aɡɹɐveɪtɪŋ kwɛstʃənz."
104233|28-000049|"A man should know when he is beaten," he added, in a moment.| "eɪ man ʃʊd nəʊ wɛn hiː ɪz biːtən," hiː adɪd, ɪn eɪ məʊmənt.
104234|28-000050|I must give her up!|aɪ mʌst ɡɪv hɜː ʌp!
104235|28-000051|misess Penniman received this declaration in silence, though it made her heart beat a little.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɹɪsiːvd ðɪs dɛkləɹeɪʃən ɪn saɪləns, ðəʊ ɪt meɪd hɜː hɑːt biːt eɪ lɪtəl.
104236|28-000052|It found her by no means unprepared, for she had accustomed herself to the thought that, if Morris should decidedly not be able to get her brother's money, it would not do for him to marry Catherine without it.|ɪt faʊnd hɜː baɪ nəʊ miːnz ʌnpɹɪpeəd, fɔː ʃiː had ɐkʌstəmd hɜːsɛlf tuː ðə θɔːt ðat, ɪf mɒɹɪs ʃʊd dɪsaɪdɪdli nɒt biː eɪbəl tuː ɡɛt hɜː bɹʌðəz mʌni, ɪt wʊd nɒt duː fɔː hɪm tuː maɹi kaθɹɪn wɪðaʊt ɪt.
104237|28-000053|"It would not do" was a vague way of putting the thing;| "ɪt wʊd nɒt duː" wɒz eɪ veɪɡ weɪ ɒv pʊtɪŋ ðə θɪŋ;
104239|28-000055|The fact that she kept her tenderness secret proves, of course, that she was ashamed of it;|ðə fakt ðat ʃiː kɛpt hɜː tɛndənəs siːkɹɪt pɹuːvz, ɒv kɔːs, ðat ʃiː wɒz ɐʃeɪmd ɒv ɪt;
104240|28-000056|but she managed to blink her shame by reminding herself that she was, after all, the official protector of her niece's marriage.|bʌt ʃiː manɪdʒd tuː blɪŋk hɜː ʃeɪm baɪ ɹɪmaɪndɪŋ hɜːsɛlf ðat ʃiː wɒz, aftə ɔːl, ðə əfɪʃəl pɹətɛktə ɒv hɜː niːsɪz maɹɪdʒ.
104241|28-000057|Her logic would scarcely have passed muster with the Doctor.|hɜː lɒdʒɪk wʊd skeəsli hav past mʌstə wɪð ðə dɒktə.
104242|28-000058|In the first place, Morris must get the money, and she would help him to it.|ɪn ðə fɜːst pleɪs, mɒɹɪs mʌst ɡɛt ðə mʌni, and ʃiː wʊd hɛlp hɪm tuː ɪt.
104244|28-000060|After her brother had delivered himself, on his return from Europe, of that incisive little address that has been quoted, Morris's cause seemed so hopeless that misess Penniman fixed her attention exclusively upon the latter branch of her argument.|aftə hɜː bɹʌðə had dɪlɪvəd hɪmsɛlf, ɒn hɪz ɹɪtɜːn fɹɒm jʊəɹəp, ɒv ðat ɪnsaɪsɪv lɪtəl ɐdɹɛs ðat haz biːn kwəʊtɪd, mɒɹɪs kɔːz siːmd səʊ həʊpləs ðat mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən fɪkst hɜː ɐtɛnʃən ɛkskluːsɪvli əpɒn ðə latə bɹantʃ ɒv hɜː ɑːɡjuːmənt.
104245|28-000061|If Morris had been her son, she would certainly have sacrificed Catherine to a superior conception of his future;|ɪf mɒɹɪs had biːn hɜː sʌn, ʃiː wʊd sɜːtənli hav sakɹɪfaɪst kaθɹɪn tuː eɪ suːpiəɹɪə kənsɛpʃən ɒv hɪz fjuːtʃə;

104247|28-000063|Nevertheless, it checked her breath a little to have the sacrificial knife, as it were, suddenly thrust into her hand.|nɛvəðəlɛs, ɪt tʃɛkt hɜː bɹɛθ eɪ lɪtəl tuː hav ðə sakɹɪfɪʃəl naɪf, az ɪt wɜː, sʌdənli θɹʌst ɪntʊ hɜː hand.
104248|28-000064|Morris walked along a moment, and then he repeated harshly: "I must give her up!"|mɒɹɪs wɔːkt ɐlɒŋ eɪ məʊmənt, and ðɛn hiː ɹɪpiːtɪd hɑːʃli: "aɪ mʌst ɡɪv hɜː ʌp!"
104249|28-000065|"I think I understand you," said misess Penniman gently.| "aɪ θɪŋk aɪ ʌndəstand juː," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən dʒɛntli.
104250|28-000066|I certainly say it distinctly enough -- brutally and vulgarly enough.|aɪ sɜːtənli seɪ ɪt dɪstɪŋktli ɪnʌf -- bɹuːtəli and vʌlɡəli ɪnʌf.
104251|28-000067|He was ashamed of himself, and his shame was uncomfortable;|hiː wɒz ɐʃeɪmd ɒv hɪmsɛlf, and hɪz ʃeɪm wɒz ʌŋkʌmftəbəl;
104252|28-000068|and as he was extremely intolerant of discomfort, he felt vicious and cruel.|and az hiː wɒz ɛkstɹiːmli ɪntɒləɹənt ɒv dɪskʌmfət, hiː fɛlt vɪʃəs and kɹuːəl.
104253|28-000069|He wanted to abuse somebody, and he began, cautiously -- for he was always cautious -- with himself.|hiː wɒntɪd tuː ɐbjuːs sʌmbɒdi, and hiː bɪɡan, kɔːʃəsli -- fɔː hiː wɒz ɔːlweɪz kɔːʃəs -- wɪð hɪmsɛlf.
104254|28-000070|"Couldn't you take her down a little?" he asked.| "kʊdnt juː teɪk hɜː daʊn eɪ lɪtəl?" hiː askt.
104255|28-000071|Take her down?|teɪk hɜː daʊn?

104257|28-000073|misess Penniman stopped, looking at him very solemnly.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən stɒpt, lʊkɪŋ at hɪm vɛɹi sɒləmli.
104258|28-000074|My poor Morris, do you know how much she loves you?|maɪ pʊə mɒɹɪs, duː juː nəʊ haʊ mʌtʃ ʃiː lʌvz juː?

104262|28-000078|It would be too painful.|ɪt wʊd biː tuː peɪnfəl.
104263|28-000079|"She will suffer much," said misess Penniman.| "ʃiː wɪl sʌfə mʌtʃ," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
104264|28-000080|You must console her.|juː mʌst kɒnsəʊl hɜː.
104265|28-000081|If you are as good a friend to me as you pretend to be, you will manage it.|ɪf juː ɑː az ɡʊd eɪ fɹɛnd tuː miː az juː pɹɪtɛnd tuː biː, juː wɪl manɪdʒ ɪt.
104267|28-000083|You talk of my 'pretending' to like you;|juː tɔːk ɒv maɪ 'pɹɪtɛndɪŋ tuː laɪk juː;
104268|28-000084|but I can't pretend to hate you.|bʌt aɪ kant pɹɪtɛnd tuː heɪt juː.
104269|28-000085|I can only tell her I think very highly of you;|aɪ kan əʊnli tɛl hɜː aɪ θɪŋk vɛɹi haɪli ɒv juː;
104270|28-000086|and how will that console her for losing you?|and haʊ wɪl ðat kɒnsəʊl hɜː fɔː luːzɪŋ juː?
104271|28-000087|The Doctor will help you.|ðə dɒktə wɪl hɛlp juː.
104272|28-000088|He will be delighted at the thing being broken off, and, as he is a knowing fellow, he will invent something to comfort her.|hiː wɪl biː dɪlaɪtɪd at ðə θɪŋ biːɪŋ bɹəʊkən ɒf, and, az hiː ɪz eɪ nəʊɪŋ fɛləʊ, hiː wɪl ɪnvɛnt sʌmθɪŋ tuː kʌmfət hɜː.
104273|28-000089|"He will invent a new torture!" cried misess Penniman.| "hiː wɪl ɪnvɛnt eɪ njuː tɔːtʃə!" kɹaɪd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
104274|28-000090|Heaven deliver her from her father's comfort.|hɛvən dɪlɪvə hɜː fɹɒm hɜː fɑːðəz kʌmfət.
104275|28-000091|It will consist of his crowing over her and saying, 'I always told you so!'|ɪt wɪl kənsɪst ɒv hɪz kɹəʊɪŋ əʊvə hɜː and seɪɪŋ, 'aɪ ɔːlweɪz təʊld juː səʊ!
104276|28-000092|Morris coloured a most uncomfortable red.|mɒɹɪs kʌləd eɪ məʊst ʌŋkʌmftəbəl ɹɛd.
104277|28-000093|If you don't console her any better than you console me, you certainly won't be of much use!|ɪf juː dəʊnt kɒnsəʊl hɜː ɛni bɛtə ðɐn juː kɒnsəʊl miː, juː sɜːtənli wɒnt biː ɒv mʌtʃ juːs!
104278|28-000094|It's a damned disagreeable necessity;|ɪts eɪ damd dɪsɐɡɹiːəbəl nəsɛsɪti;
104279|28-000095|I feel it extremely, and you ought to make it easy for me.|aɪ fiːl ɪt ɛkstɹiːmli, and juː ɔːt tuː meɪk ɪt iːzi fɔː miː.
104280|28-000096|"I will be your friend for life!" misess Penniman declared.| "aɪ wɪl biː jɔː fɹɛnd fɔː laɪf!" mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən dɪkleəd.
104281|28-000097|Be my friend now!|biː maɪ fɹɛnd naʊ!
104282|28-000098|And Morris walked on.|and mɒɹɪs wɔːkt ɒn.
104283|28-000099|She went with him;|ʃiː wɛnt wɪð hɪm;
104284|28-000100|she was almost trembling.|ʃiː wɒz ɔːlməʊst tɹɛmblɪŋ.
104285|28-000101|"Should you like me to tell her?" she asked.| "ʃʊd juː laɪk miː tuː tɛl hɜː?" ʃiː askt.
104286|28-000102|You mustn't tell her, but you can -- you can.|juː mʌstnt tɛl hɜː, bʌt juː kan -- juː kan.
104287|28-000103|And he hesitated, trying to think what misess Penniman could do.|and hiː hɛzɪteɪtɪd, tɹaɪɪŋ tuː θɪŋk wɒt mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən kʊd duː.
104288|28-000104|You can explain to her why it is.|juː kan ɛkspleɪn tuː hɜː waɪ ɪt ɪz.
104289|28-000105|It's because I can't bring myself to step in between her and her father -- to give him the pretext he grasps at -- so eagerly (it's a hideous sight) for depriving her of her rights.|ɪts bɪkɒz aɪ kant bɹɪŋ maɪsɛlf tuː stɛp ɪn bɪtwiːn hɜː and hɜː fɑːðə -- tuː ɡɪv hɪm ðə pɹiːtɛkst hiː ɡɹasps at -- səʊ iːɡəli (ɪts eɪ hɪdiəs saɪt) fɔː dɪpɹaɪvɪŋ hɜː ɒv hɜː ɹaɪts.
104290|28-000106|misess Penniman felt with remarkable promptitude the charm of this formula.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən fɛlt wɪð ɹɪmɑːkəbəl pɹɒmptɪtjuːd ðə tʃɑːm ɒv ðɪs fɔːmjʊlə.
104291|28-000107|"That's so like you," she said;| "ðats səʊ laɪk juː," ʃiː sɛd;
104292|28-000108|it's so finely felt.|ɪts səʊ faɪnli fɛlt.
104293|28-000109|Morris gave his stick an angry swing.|mɒɹɪs ɡeɪv hɪz stɪk an aŋɡɹi swɪŋ.
104294|28-000110|"Oh, botheration!" he exclaimed perversely.| "əʊ, bɒðəɹeɪʃən!" hiː ɛkskleɪmd pəvɜːsli.
104295|28-000111|misess Penniman, however, was not discouraged.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, haʊɛvə, wɒz nɒt dɪskʌɹɪdʒd.
104296|28-000112|It may turn out better than you think.|ɪt meɪ tɜːn aʊt bɛtə ðɐn juː θɪŋk.
104297|28-000113|Catherine is, after all, so very peculiar.|kaθɹɪn ɪz, aftə ɔːl, səʊ vɛɹi pɪkjuːliə.
104299|28-000115|They extended their walk, and, while they proceeded, misess Penniman took upon herself other things besides, and ended by having assumed a considerable burden;|ðeɪ ɛkstɛndɪd ðeə wɔːk, and, waɪl ðeɪ pɹəsiːdɪd, mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən tʊk əpɒn hɜːsɛlf ʌðə θɪŋz bɪsaɪdz, and ɛndɪd baɪ havɪŋ ɐsjuːmd eɪ kənsɪdəɹəbəl bɜːdən;
104300|28-000116|Morris being ready enough, as may be imagined, to put everything off upon her.|mɒɹɪs biːɪŋ ɹɛdi ɪnʌf, az meɪ biː ɪmadʒɪnd, tuː pʊt ɛvɹɪθɪŋ ɒf əpɒn hɜː.
104301|28-000117|But he was not for a single instant the dupe of her blundering alacrity;|bʌt hiː wɒz nɒt fɔː eɪ sɪŋɡəl ɪnstənt ðə djuːp ɒv hɜː blʌndəɹɪŋ ɐlakɹɪti;
104302|28-000118|he knew that of what she promised she was competent to perform but an insignificant fraction, and the more she professed her willingness to serve him, the greater fool he thought her.|hiː njuː ðat ɒv wɒt ʃiː pɹɒmɪst ʃiː wɒz kɒmpɪtənt tuː pəfɔːm bʌt an ɪnsɪɡnɪfɪkənt fɹakʃən, and ðə mɔː ʃiː pɹəfɛst hɜː wɪlɪŋnəs tuː sɜːv hɪm, ðə ɡɹeɪtə fuːl hiː θɔːt hɜː.
104303|28-000119|"What will you do if you don't marry her?" she ventured to inquire in the course of this conversation.| "wɒt wɪl juː duː ɪf juː dəʊnt maɹi hɜː?" ʃiː vɛntʃəd tuː ɪŋkwaɪə ɪn ðə kɔːs ɒv ðɪs kɒnvəseɪʃən.
104304|28-000120|"Something brilliant," said Morris.| "sʌmθɪŋ bɹɪliənt," sɛd mɒɹɪs.
104305|28-000121|Shouldn't you like me to do something brilliant?|ʃʊdnt juː laɪk miː tuː duː sʌmθɪŋ bɹɪliənt?
104306|28-000122|The idea gave misess Penniman exceeding pleasure.|ðə aɪdiə ɡeɪv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɛksiːdɪŋ plɛʒə.
104307|28-000123|I shall feel sadly taken in if you don't.|aɪ ʃal fiːl sadli teɪkən ɪn ɪf juː dəʊnt.
104308|28-000124|I shall have to, to make up for this.|aɪ ʃal hav tuː, tuː meɪk ʌp fɔː ðɪs.
104309|28-000125|This isn't at all brilliant, you know.|ðɪs ɪsnt at ɔːl bɹɪliənt, juː nəʊ.
104310|28-000126|misess Penniman mused a little, as if there might be some way of making out that it was;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən mjuːzd eɪ lɪtəl, az ɪf ðeə maɪt biː sʌm weɪ ɒv meɪkɪŋ aʊt ðat ɪt wɒz;
104311|28-000127|but she had to give up the attempt, and, to carry off the awkwardness of failure, she risked a new inquiry.|bʌt ʃiː had tuː ɡɪv ʌp ðə ɐtɛmpt, and, tuː kaɹi ɒf ðə ɔːkwədnəs ɒv feɪliə, ʃiː ɹɪskt eɪ njuː ɪŋkwaɪəɹi.
104312|28-000128|Do you mean -- do you mean another marriage?|duː juː miːn -- duː juː miːn ɐnʌðə maɹɪdʒ?
104313|28-000129|Morris greeted this question with a reflexion which was hardly the less impudent from being inaudible.|mɒɹɪs ɡɹiːtɪd ðɪs kwɛstʃən wɪð eɪ ɹiːflɛksiən wɪtʃ wɒz hɑːdli ðə lɛs ɪmpjuːdənt fɹɒm biːɪŋ ɪnɔːdɪbəl.
104314|28-000130|Surely, women are more crude than men!|ʃʊəli, wɪmɪn ɑː mɔː kɹuːd ðɐn mɛn!
104315|28-000131|And then he answered audibly:|and ðɛn hiː ansəd ɔːdɪbli:
104316|28-000132|Never in the world!|nɛvə ɪn ðə wɜːld!
104317|28-000133|misess Penniman felt disappointed and snubbed, and she relieved herself in a little vaguely-sarcastic cry.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən fɛlt dɪsɐpɔɪntɪd and snʌbd, and ʃiː ɹɪliːvd hɜːsɛlf ɪn eɪ lɪtəl veɪɡlɪsɑːkastɪk kɹaɪ.
104318|28-000134|He was certainly perverse.|hiː wɒz sɜːtənli pəvɜːs.
104319|28-000135|"I give her up, not for another woman, but for a wider career!" Morris announced.| "aɪ ɡɪv hɜː ʌp, nɒt fɔː ɐnʌðə wʊmən, bʌt fɔː eɪ waɪdə kəɹiə!" mɒɹɪs ɐnaʊnst.
104320|28-000136|This was very grand;|ðɪs wɒz vɛɹi ɡɹand;
104321|28-000137|but still misess Penniman, who felt that she had exposed herself, was faintly rancorous.|bʌt stɪl mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː fɛlt ðat ʃiː had ɛkspəʊzd hɜːsɛlf, wɒz feɪntli ɹaŋkəɹəs.

104324|28-000140|but what is the use of dragging it out?|bʌt wɒt ɪz ðə juːs ɒv dɹaɡɪŋ ɪt aʊt?
104325|28-000141|I have been four times since she came back, and it's terribly awkward work.|aɪ hav biːn fɔː taɪmz sɪns ʃiː keɪm bak, and ɪts tɛɹɪbli ɔːkwəd wɜːk.
104326|28-000142|I can't keep it up indefinitely;|aɪ kant kiːp ɪt ʌp ɪndɛfɪnətli;
104327|28-000143|she oughtn't to expect that, you know.|ʃiː ɔːtnt tuː ɛkspɛkt ðat, juː nəʊ.
104328|28-000144|"A woman should never keep a man dangling!" he added finely.| "eɪ wʊmən ʃʊd nɛvə kiːp eɪ man daŋɡəlɪŋ!" hiː adɪd faɪnli.
104329|29-000001|he came again, without managing the last parting;|hiː keɪm ɐɡɛn, wɪðaʊt manɪdʒɪŋ ðə last pɑːtɪŋ;
104330|29-000002|and again and again, without finding that misess Penniman had as yet done much to pave the path of retreat with flowers.|and ɐɡɛn and ɐɡɛn, wɪðaʊt faɪndɪŋ ðat mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had az jɛt dʌn mʌtʃ tuː peɪv ðə paθ ɒv ɹɪtɹiːt wɪð flaʊəz.
104331|29-000003|It was devilish awkward, as he said, and he felt a lively animosity for Catherine's aunt, who, as he had now quite formed the habit of saying to himself, had dragged him into the mess and was bound in common charity to get him out of it.|ɪt wɒz dɛvɪlɪʃ ɔːkwəd, az hiː sɛd, and hiː fɛlt eɪ laɪvlɪ anɪmɒsɪti fɔː kaθɹɪnz ant, huː, az hiː had naʊ kwaɪt fɔːmd ðə habɪt ɒv seɪɪŋ tuː hɪmsɛlf, had dɹaɡd hɪm ɪntʊ ðə mɛs and wɒz baʊnd ɪn kɒmən tʃaɹɪti tuː ɡɛt hɪm aʊt ɒv ɪt.
104332|29-000004|misess Penniman, to tell the truth, had, in the seclusion of her own apartment -- and, I may add, amid the suggestiveness of Catherine's, which wore in those days the appearance of that of a young lady laying out her trousseau -- misess Penniman had measured her responsibilities, and taken fright at their magnitude.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, tuː tɛl ðə tɹuːθ, had, ɪn ðə sɪkluːʒən ɒv hɜː əʊn ɐpɑːtmənt -- and, aɪ meɪ ad, ɐmɪd ðə sədʒɛstɪvnəs ɒv kaθɹɪnz, wɪtʃ wɔː ɪn ðəʊz deɪz ðə ɐpiəɹəns ɒv ðat ɒv eɪ jʌŋ leɪdi leɪɪŋ aʊt hɜː tɹaʊsəʊ -- mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had mɛʒəd hɜː ɹɪspɒnsəbɪlɪtiz, and teɪkən fɹaɪt at ðeə maɡnɪtjuːd.
104333|29-000005|The task of preparing Catherine and easing off Morris presented difficulties which increased in the execution, and even led the impulsive Lavinia to ask herself whether the modification of the young man's original project had been conceived in a happy spirit.|ðə task ɒv pɹɪpeəɹɪŋ kaθɹɪn and iːzɪŋ ɒf mɒɹɪs pɹɪzɛntɪd dɪfɪkʌltiz wɪtʃ ɪŋkɹiːst ɪn ðə ɛksɪkjuːʃən, and iːvən lɛd ðə ɪmpʌlsɪv lavɪniə tuː ask hɜːsɛlf wɛðə ðə mɒdɪfɪkeɪʃən ɒv ðə jʌŋ manz əɹɪdʒɪnəl pɹɒdʒɛkt had biːn kənsiːvd ɪn eɪ hapi spɪɹɪt.
104334|29-000006|A brilliant future, a wider career, a conscience exempt from the reproach of interference between a young lady and her natural rights -- these excellent things might be too troublesomely purchased.|eɪ bɹɪliənt fjuːtʃə, eɪ waɪdə kəɹiə, eɪ kɒnʃəns ɛɡzɛmpt fɹɒm ðə ɹɪpɹəʊtʃ ɒv ɪntəfiəɹəns bɪtwiːn eɪ jʌŋ leɪdi and hɜː natʃəɹəl ɹaɪts -- ðiːz ɛksələnt θɪŋz maɪt biː tuː tɹʌbəlsʌmli pɜːtʃɪst.
104335|29-000007|From Catherine herself misess Penniman received no assistance whatever;|fɹɒm kaθɹɪn hɜːsɛlf mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɹɪsiːvd nəʊ ɐsɪstəns wɒtɛvə;

104337|29-000009|She looked at her lover with eyes of undiminished trust, and though she had less confidence in her aunt than in a young man with whom she had exchanged so many tender vows, she gave her no handle for explaining or confessing.|ʃiː lʊkt at hɜː lʌvə wɪð aɪz ɒv ʌndɪmɪnɪʃt tɹʌst, and ðəʊ ʃiː had lɛs kɒnfɪdəns ɪn hɜː ant ðɐn ɪn eɪ jʌŋ man wɪð huːm ʃiː had ɛkstʃeɪndʒd səʊ mɛni tɛndə vaʊz, ʃiː ɡeɪv hɜː nəʊ handəl fɔː ɛkspleɪnɪŋ ɔː kənfɛsɪŋ.
104338|29-000010|misess Penniman, faltering and wavering, declared Catherine was very stupid, put off the great scene, as she would have called it, from day to day, and wandered about very uncomfortably, primed, to repletion, with her apology, but unable to bring it to the light.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, fɒltəɹɪŋ and weɪvəɹɪŋ, dɪkleəd kaθɹɪn wɒz vɛɹi stjuːpɪd, pʊt ɒf ðə ɡɹeɪt siːn, az ʃiː wʊd hav kɔːld ɪt, fɹɒm deɪ tuː deɪ, and wɒndəd ɐbaʊt vɛɹi ʌŋkʌmftəbli, pɹaɪmd, tuː ɹɪpliːʃən, wɪð hɜː ɐpɒlədʒi, bʌt ʌneɪbəl tuː bɹɪŋ ɪt tuː ðə laɪt.

104341|29-000013|He made his visits as brief as possible, and while he sat with his mistress, found terribly little to talk about.|hiː meɪd hɪz vɪzɪts az bɹiːf az pɒsɪbəl, and waɪl hiː sat wɪð hɪz mɪstɹəs, faʊnd tɛɹɪbli lɪtəl tuː tɔːk ɐbaʊt.

104346|29-000018|She was waiting on his good pleasure, and would wait modestly and patiently;|ʃiː wɒz weɪtɪŋ ɒn hɪz ɡʊd plɛʒə, and wʊd weɪt mɒdɪstli and peɪʃəntli;
104347|29-000019|his hanging back at this supreme time might appear strange, but of course he must have a good reason for it.|hɪz haŋɪŋ bak at ðɪs suːpɹiːm taɪm maɪt ɐpiə stɹeɪndʒ, bʌt ɒv kɔːs hiː mʌst hav eɪ ɡʊd ɹiːzən fɔː ɪt.
104348|29-000020|Catherine would have made a wife of the gentle old-fashioned pattern -- regarding reasons as favours and windfalls, but no more expecting one every day than she would have expected a bouquet of camellias.|kaθɹɪn wʊd hav meɪd eɪ waɪf ɒv ðə dʒɛntəl əʊldfaʃənd patən -- ɹɪɡɑːdɪŋ ɹiːzənz az feɪvəz and wɪndfɔːlz, bʌt nəʊ mɔː ɛkspɛktɪŋ wɒn ɛvɹɪ deɪ ðɐn ʃiː wʊd hav ɛkspɛktɪd eɪ buːkeɪ ɒv kamɛliəz.
104349|29-000021|During the period of her engagement, however, a young lady even of the most slender pretensions counts upon more bouquets than at other times;|djʊəɹɪŋ ðə piəɹɪəd ɒv hɜː ɛŋɡeɪdʒmənt, haʊɛvə, eɪ jʌŋ leɪdi iːvən ɒv ðə məʊst slɛndə pɹɪtɛnʃənz kaʊnts əpɒn mɔː buːkeɪs ðɐn at ʌðə taɪmz;
104350|29-000022|and there was a want of perfume in the air at this moment which at last excited the girl's alarm.|and ðeə wɒz eɪ wɒnt ɒv pɜːfjuːm ɪn ðə eə at ðɪs məʊmənt wɪtʃ at last ɛksaɪtɪd ðə ɡɜːlz ɐlɑːm.
104351|29-000023|"Are you sick?" she asked of Morris.| "ɑː juː sɪk?" ʃiː askt ɒv mɒɹɪs.
104352|29-000024|You seem so restless, and you look pale.|juː siːm səʊ ɹɛstləs, and juː lʊk peɪl.
104353|29-000025|"I am not at all well," said Morris;| "aɪ am nɒt at ɔːl wɛl," sɛd mɒɹɪs;
104354|29-000026|and it occurred to him that, if he could only make her pity him enough, he might get off.|and ɪt əkɜːd tuː hɪm ðat, ɪf hiː kʊd əʊnli meɪk hɜː pɪti hɪm ɪnʌf, hiː maɪt ɡɛt ɒf.

104356|29-000028|you oughtn't to work so much.|juː ɔːtnt tuː wɜːk səʊ mʌtʃ.
104357|29-000029|I must do that.|aɪ mʌst duː ðat.
104358|29-000030|And then he added, with a sort of calculated brutality, "I don't want to owe you everything!"|and ðɛn hiː adɪd, wɪð eɪ sɔːt ɒv kalkjʊleɪtɪd bɹuːtalɪti, "aɪ dəʊnt wɒnt tuː əʊ juː ɛvɹɪθɪŋ!"
104359|29-000031|Ah, how can you say that?|ɑː, haʊ kan juː seɪ ðat?
104360|29-000032|"I am too proud," said Morris.| "aɪ am tuː pɹaʊd," sɛd mɒɹɪs.
104361|29-000033|Yes -- you are too proud!|jɛs -- juː ɑː tuː pɹaʊd!
104362|29-000034|"Well, you must take me as I am," he went on, "you can never change me."| "wɛl, juː mʌst teɪk miː az aɪ am," hiː wɛnt ɒn, "juː kan nɛvə tʃeɪndʒ miː."
104363|29-000035|"I don't want to change you," she said gently.| "aɪ dəʊnt wɒnt tuː tʃeɪndʒ juː," ʃiː sɛd dʒɛntli.
104364|29-000036|I will take you as you are!|aɪ wɪl teɪk juː az juː ɑː!
104365|29-000037|And she stood looking at him.|and ʃiː stʊd lʊkɪŋ at hɪm.
104366|29-000038|"You know people talk tremendously about a man's marrying a rich girl," Morris remarked.| "juː nəʊ piːpəl tɔːk tɹəmɛndəsli ɐbaʊt eɪ manz maɹiɪŋ eɪ ɹɪtʃ ɡɜːl," mɒɹɪs ɹɪmɑːkt.
104367|29-000039|It's excessively disagreeable.|ɪts ɛksɛsɪvli dɪsɐɡɹiːəbəl.
104368|29-000040|"But I am not rich?" said Catherine.| "bʌt aɪ am nɒt ɹɪtʃ?" sɛd kaθɹɪn.
104369|29-000041|You are rich enough to make me talked about!|juː ɑː ɹɪtʃ ɪnʌf tuː meɪk miː tɔːkt ɐbaʊt!
104370|29-000042|Of course you are talked about.|ɒv kɔːs juː ɑː tɔːkt ɐbaʊt.
104371|29-000043|It's an honour!|ɪts an ɒnə!
104372|29-000044|It's an honour I could easily dispense with.|ɪts an ɒnə aɪ kʊd iːzili dɪspɛns wɪð.
104373|29-000045|She was on the point of asking him whether it were not a compensation for this annoyance that the poor girl who had the misfortune to bring it upon him, loved him so dearly and believed in him so truly;|ʃiː wɒz ɒn ðə pɔɪnt ɒv askɪŋ hɪm wɛðə ɪt wɜː nɒt eɪ kɒmpənseɪʃən fɔː ðɪs ɐnɔɪəns ðat ðə pʊə ɡɜːl huː had ðə mɪsfɔːtʃuːn tuː bɹɪŋ ɪt əpɒn hɪm, lʌvd hɪm səʊ diəli and bɪliːvd ɪn hɪm səʊ tɹuːli;
104374|29-000046|but she hesitated, thinking that this would perhaps seem an exacting speech, and while she hesitated, he suddenly left her.|bʌt ʃiː hɛzɪteɪtɪd, θɪŋkɪŋ ðat ðɪs wʊd pəhaps siːm an ɛɡzaktɪŋ spiːtʃ, and waɪl ʃiː hɛzɪteɪtɪd, hiː sʌdənli lɛft hɜː.
104375|29-000047|The next time he came, however, she brought it out, and she told him again that he was too proud.|ðə nɛkst taɪm hiː keɪm, haʊɛvə, ʃiː bɹɔːt ɪt aʊt, and ʃiː təʊld hɪm ɐɡɛn ðat hiː wɒz tuː pɹaʊd.
104376|29-000048|He repeated that he couldn't change, and this time she felt the impulse to say that with a little effort he might change.|hiː ɹɪpiːtɪd ðat hiː kʊdnt tʃeɪndʒ, and ðɪs taɪm ʃiː fɛlt ðə ɪmpʌls tuː seɪ ðat wɪð eɪ lɪtəl ɛfət hiː maɪt tʃeɪndʒ.
104378|29-000050|but the question was how to quarrel with a young woman who had such treasures of concession.|bʌt ðə kwɛstʃən wɒz haʊ tuː kwɒɹəl wɪð eɪ jʌŋ wʊmən huː had sʌtʃ tɹɛʒəz ɒv kənsɛʃən.
104379|29-000051|"I suppose you think the effort is all on your side!" he was reduced to exclaiming.| "aɪ səpəʊz juː θɪŋk ðə ɛfət ɪz ɔːl ɒn jɔː saɪd!" hiː wɒz ɹɪdjuːst tuː ɛkskleɪmɪŋ.
104380|29-000052|Don't you believe that I have my own effort to make?|dəʊnt juː bɪliːv ðat aɪ hav maɪ əʊn ɛfət tuː meɪk?
104381|29-000053|"It's all yours now," she said.| "ɪts ɔːl jɔːz naʊ," ʃiː sɛd.
104382|29-000054|My effort is finished and done with!|maɪ ɛfət ɪz fɪnɪʃt and dʌn wɪð!
104383|29-000055|Well, mine is not.|wɛl, maɪn ɪz nɒt.
104384|29-000056|"We must bear things together," said Catherine.| "wiː mʌst beə θɪŋz təɡɛðə," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
104385|29-000057|That's what we ought to do.|ðats wɒt wiː ɔːt tuː duː.
104386|29-000058|Morris attempted a natural smile.|mɒɹɪs ɐtɛmptɪd eɪ natʃəɹəl smaɪl.
104387|29-000059|There are some things which we can't very well bear together -- for instance, separation.|ðeə ɑː sʌm θɪŋz wɪtʃ wiː kant vɛɹi wɛl beə təɡɛðə -- fɔː ɪnstəns, sɛpəɹeɪʃən.
104388|29-000060|Why do you speak of separation?|waɪ duː juː spiːk ɒv sɛpəɹeɪʃən?
104389|29-000061|Ah! you don't like it;|ɑː! juː dəʊnt laɪk ɪt;
104390|29-000062|I knew you wouldn't!|aɪ njuː juː wʊdnt!
104391|29-000063|"Where are you going, Morris?" she suddenly asked.| "weə ɑː juː ɡəʊɪŋ, mɒɹɪs?" ʃiː sʌdənli askt.
104392|29-000064|He fixed his eye on her for a moment, and for a part of that moment she was afraid of it.|hiː fɪkst hɪz aɪ ɒn hɜː fɔː eɪ məʊmənt, and fɔː eɪ pɑːt ɒv ðat məʊmənt ʃiː wɒz ɐfɹeɪd ɒv ɪt.
104393|29-000065|Will you promise not to make a scene?|wɪl juː pɹɒmɪs nɒt tuː meɪk eɪ siːn?
104395|29-000067|"All women do!" said Morris, with the tone of large experience.| "ɔːl wɪmɪn duː!" sɛd mɒɹɪs, wɪð ðə təʊn ɒv lɑːdʒ ɛkspiəɹɪəns.
104396|29-000068|I don't.|aɪ dəʊnt.
104397|29-000069|Where are you going?|weə ɑː juː ɡəʊɪŋ?
104399|29-000071|She wondered a moment, gazing at him.|ʃiː wʌndəd eɪ məʊmənt, ɡeɪzɪŋ at hɪm.
104401|29-000073|Not if you will take me with you.|nɒt ɪf juː wɪl teɪk miː wɪð juː.
104402|29-000074|Take you with me -- on business?|teɪk juː wɪð miː -- ɒn bɪznəs?
104403|29-000075|What is your business?|wɒt ɪz jɔː bɪznəs?
104404|29-000076|Your business is to be with me.|jɔː bɪznəs ɪz tuː biː wɪð miː.
104405|29-000077|"I don't earn my living with you," said Morris.| "aɪ dəʊnt ɜːn maɪ lɪvɪŋ wɪð juː," sɛd mɒɹɪs.
104406|29-000078|"Or rather," he cried with a sudden inspiration, "that's just what I do -- or what the world says I do!"| "ɔː ɹɑːðə," hiː kɹaɪd wɪð eɪ sʌdən ɪnspəɹeɪʃən, "ðats dʒʌst wɒt aɪ duː -- ɔː wɒt ðə wɜːld sɛz aɪ duː!"
104407|29-000079|This ought perhaps to have been a great stroke, but it miscarried.|ðɪs ɔːt pəhaps tuː hav biːn eɪ ɡɹeɪt stɹəʊk, bʌt ɪt mɪskaɹid.
104408|29-000080|Where are you going?|weə ɑː juː ɡəʊɪŋ?
104409|29-000081|Catherine simply repeated.|kaθɹɪn sɪmpli ɹɪpiːtɪd.
104410|29-000082|To New Orleans.|tuː njuː ɔːliənz.
104411|29-000083|About buying some cotton.|ɐbaʊt baɪɪŋ sʌm kɒtən.
104412|29-000084|"I am perfectly willing to go to New Orleans." Catherine said.| "aɪ am pɜːfɛktlɪ wɪlɪŋ tuː ɡəʊ tuː njuː ɔːliənz." kaθɹɪn sɛd.
104413|29-000085|"Do you suppose I would take you to a nest of yellow fever?" cried Morris.| "duː juː səpəʊz aɪ wʊd teɪk juː tuː eɪ nɛst ɒv jɛləʊ fiːvə?" kɹaɪd mɒɹɪs.
104414|29-000086|Do you suppose I would expose you at such a time as this?|duː juː səpəʊz aɪ wʊd ɛkspəʊz juː at sʌtʃ eɪ taɪm az ðɪs?
104415|29-000087|If there is yellow fever, why should you go?|ɪf ðeə ɪz jɛləʊ fiːvə, waɪ ʃʊd juː ɡəʊ?
104416|29-000088|Morris, you must not go!|mɒɹɪs, juː mʌst nɒt ɡəʊ!
104417|29-000089|"It is to make six thousand dollars," said Morris.| "ɪt ɪz tuː meɪk sɪks θaʊzənd dɒləz," sɛd mɒɹɪs.
104418|29-000090|Do you grudge me that satisfaction?|duː juː ɡɹʌdʒ miː ðat satɪsfakʃən?
104419|29-000091|We have no need of six thousand dollars.|wiː hav nəʊ niːd ɒv sɪks θaʊzənd dɒləz.
104420|29-000092|You think too much about money!|juː θɪŋk tuː mʌtʃ ɐbaʊt mʌni!
104421|29-000093|You can afford to say that?|juː kan ɐfɔːd tuː seɪ ðat?
104422|29-000094|This is a great chance;|ðɪs ɪz eɪ ɡɹeɪt tʃans;
104423|29-000095|we heard of it last night.|wiː hɜːd ɒv ɪt last naɪt.
104424|29-000096|And he explained to her in what the chance consisted;|and hiː ɛkspleɪnd tuː hɜː ɪn wɒt ðə tʃans kənsɪstɪd;
104426|29-000098|But Catherine's imagination, for reasons best known to herself, absolutely refused to be fired.|bʌt kaθɹɪnz ɪmadʒɪneɪʃən, fɔː ɹiːzənz bɛst nəʊn tuː hɜːsɛlf, absəluːtli ɹɪfjuːzd tuː biː faɪəd.

104428|29-000100|Why shouldn't you catch yellow fever quite as easily as I?|waɪ ʃʊdnt juː katʃ jɛləʊ fiːvə kwaɪt az iːzili az aɪ?

104430|29-000102|When we were in Europe, we were in very unhealthy places;|wɛn wiː wɜː ɪn jʊəɹəp, wiː wɜː ɪn vɛɹi ʌnhɛlθi pleɪsɪz;

104433|29-000105|What will be the use of six thousand dollars if you die of a fever?|wɒt wɪl biː ðə juːs ɒv sɪks θaʊzənd dɒləz ɪf juː daɪ ɒv eɪ fiːvə?
104435|29-000107|You shouldn't think about cotton, you should think about me.|juː ʃʊdnt θɪŋk ɐbaʊt kɒtən, juː ʃʊd θɪŋk ɐbaʊt miː.
104436|29-000108|You can go to New Orleans some other time -- there will always be plenty of cotton.|juː kan ɡəʊ tuː njuː ɔːliənz sʌm ʌðə taɪm -- ðeə wɪl ɔːlweɪz biː plɛnti ɒv kɒtən.
104437|29-000109|It isn't the moment to choose -- we have waited too long already.|ɪt ɪsnt ðə məʊmənt tuː tʃuːz -- wiː hav weɪtɪd tuː lɒŋ ɔːlɹɛdi.
104438|29-000110|She spoke more forcibly and volubly than he had ever heard her, and she held his arm in her two hands.|ʃiː spəʊk mɔː fɔːsɪbli and vɒlʌbli ðɐn hiː had ɛvə hɜːd hɜː, and ʃiː hɛld hɪz ɑːm ɪn hɜː tuː handz.

104444|29-000116|And it was a comfort to her to think that she had hitherto asked so little;|and ɪt wɒz eɪ kʌmfət tuː hɜː tuː θɪŋk ðat ʃiː had hɪðətuː askt səʊ lɪtəl;
104445|29-000117|it seemed to make her right to insist the greater now.|ɪt siːmd tuː meɪk hɜː ɹaɪt tuː ɪnsɪst ðə ɡɹeɪtə naʊ.
104446|29-000118|Morris bethought himself a little.|mɒɹɪs bɛθɔːt hɪmsɛlf eɪ lɪtəl.
104447|29-000119|Very well, then;|vɛɹi wɛl, ðɛn;

104450|29-000122|And he began to smooth his hat, as if to take leave.|and hiː bɪɡan tuː smuːð hɪz hat, az ɪf tuː teɪk liːv.

104461|29-000133|It is only for a moment.|ɪt ɪz əʊnli fɔː eɪ məʊmənt.

104477|29-000149|It was Catherine's wish that there should be no violence about her save the beating of her heart, which she could not help;|ɪt wɒz kaθɹɪnz wɪʃ ðat ðeə ʃʊd biː nəʊ vaɪələns ɐbaʊt hɜː seɪv ðə biːtɪŋ ɒv hɜː hɑːt, wɪtʃ ʃiː kʊd nɒt hɛlp;
104478|29-000150|and she went on, as gently as possible, "Will you promise to come to-morrow?"|and ʃiː wɛnt ɒn, az dʒɛntli az pɒsɪbəl, "wɪl juː pɹɒmɪs tuː kʌm təmɒɹəʊ?"
104479|29-000151|I said Saturday!|aɪ sɛd satədeɪ!
104480|29-000152|Morris answered, smiling.|mɒɹɪs ansəd, smaɪlɪŋ.
104481|29-000153|He tried a frown at one moment, a smile at another;|hiː tɹaɪd eɪ fɹaʊn at wɒn məʊmənt, eɪ smaɪl at ɐnʌðə;
104482|29-000154|he was at his wit's end.|hiː wɒz at hɪz wɪts ɛnd.
104483|29-000155|"Yes, Saturday too," she answered, trying to smile.| "jɛs, satədeɪ tuː," ʃiː ansəd, tɹaɪɪŋ tuː smaɪl.
104484|29-000156|But to-morrow first.|bʌt təmɒɹəʊ fɜːst.
104485|29-000157|He was going to the door, and she went with him quickly.|hiː wɒz ɡəʊɪŋ tuː ðə dɔː, and ʃiː wɛnt wɪð hɪm kwɪkli.
104486|29-000158|She leaned her shoulder against it;|ʃiː liːnd hɜː ʃəʊldə ɐɡɛnst ɪt;
104487|29-000159|it seemed to her that she would do anything to keep him.|ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː ðat ʃiː wʊd duː ɛnɪθɪŋ tuː kiːp hɪm.
104489|29-000161|How can you be prevented?|haʊ kan juː biː pɹɪvɛntɪd?
104490|29-000162|You can come if you will.|juː kan kʌm ɪf juː wɪl.
104491|29-000163|"I am a busy man -- I am not a dangler!" cried Morris sternly.| "aɪ am eɪ bɪzi man -- aɪ am nɒt eɪ daŋɡlə!" kɹaɪd mɒɹɪs stɜːnli.
104492|29-000164|His voice was so hard and unnatural that, with a helpless look at him, she turned away;|hɪz vɔɪs wɒz səʊ hɑːd and ʌnnatʃəɹəl ðat, wɪð eɪ hɛlpləs lʊk at hɪm, ʃiː tɜːnd ɐweɪ;
104493|29-000165|and then he quickly laid his hand on the door-knob.|and ðɛn hiː kwɪkli leɪd hɪz hand ɒn ðə dɔːnɒb.
104494|29-000166|He felt as if he were absolutely running away from her.|hiː fɛlt az ɪf hiː wɜː absəluːtli ɹʌnɪŋ ɐweɪ fɹɒm hɜː.
104495|29-000167|But in an instant she was close to him again, and murmuring in a tone none the less penetrating for being low, "Morris, you are going to leave me."|bʌt ɪn an ɪnstənt ʃiː wɒz kləʊs tuː hɪm ɐɡɛn, and mɜːməɹɪŋ ɪn eɪ təʊn nʌn ðə lɛs pɛnɪtɹeɪtɪŋ fɔː biːɪŋ ləʊ, "mɒɹɪs, juː ɑː ɡəʊɪŋ tuː liːv miː."
104496|29-000168|Yes, for a little while.|jɛs, fɔː eɪ lɪtəl waɪl.

104500|29-000172|And she tried to keep him longer;|and ʃiː tɹaɪd tuː kiːp hɪm lɒŋɡə;
104501|29-000173|it was almost a struggle.|ɪt wɒz ɔːlməʊst eɪ stɹʌɡəl.
104502|29-000174|"Think of what I have done!" she broke out.| "θɪŋk ɒv wɒt aɪ hav dʌn!" ʃiː bɹəʊk aʊt.
104503|29-000175|Morris, I have given up everything!|mɒɹɪs, aɪ hav ɡɪvən ʌp ɛvɹɪθɪŋ!
104504|29-000176|You shall have everything back!|juː ʃal hav ɛvɹɪθɪŋ bak!
104505|29-000177|You wouldn't say that if you didn't mean something.|juː wʊdnt seɪ ðat ɪf juː dɪdnt miːn sʌmθɪŋ.
104506|29-000178|What is it? -- what has happened? -- what have I done? -- what has changed you?|wɒt ɪz ɪt? -- wɒt haz hapənd? -- wɒt hav aɪ dʌn? -- wɒt haz tʃeɪndʒd juː?
104507|29-000179|"I will write to you -- that is better," Morris stammered.| "aɪ wɪl ɹaɪt tuː juː -- ðat ɪz bɛtə," mɒɹɪs staməd.
104508|29-000180|"Ah, you won't come back!" she cried, bursting into tears.| "ɑː, juː wɒnt kʌm bak!" ʃiː kɹaɪd, bɜːstɪŋ ɪntʊ tiəz.
104510|30-000001|it was almost her last outbreak of passive grief;|ɪt wɒz ɔːlməʊst hɜː last aʊtbɹeɪk ɒv pasɪv ɡɹiːf;
104511|30-000002|at least, she never indulged in another that the world knew anything about.|at liːst, ʃiː nɛvə ɪndʌldʒd ɪn ɐnʌðə ðat ðə wɜːld njuː ɛnɪθɪŋ ɐbaʊt.
104512|30-000003|But this one was long and terrible;|bʌt ðɪs wɒn wɒz lɒŋ and tɛɹɪbəl;
104513|30-000004|she flung herself on the sofa and gave herself up to her misery.|ʃiː flʌŋ hɜːsɛlf ɒn ðə səʊfə and ɡeɪv hɜːsɛlf ʌp tuː hɜː mɪzəɹi.
104514|30-000005|She hardly knew what had happened;|ʃiː hɑːdli njuː wɒt had hapənd;
104515|30-000006|ostensibly she had only had a difference with her lover, as other girls had had before, and the thing was not only not a rupture, but she was under no obligation to regard it even as a menace.|ɒstɛnsɪbli ʃiː had əʊnli had eɪ dɪfɹəns wɪð hɜː lʌvə, az ʌðə ɡɜːlz had had bɪfɔː, and ðə θɪŋ wɒz nɒt əʊnli nɒt eɪ ɹʌptʃə, bʌt ʃiː wɒz ʌndə nəʊ ɒblɪɡeɪʃən tuː ɹɪɡɑːd ɪt iːvən az eɪ mɛnɪs.
104516|30-000007|Nevertheless, she felt a wound, even if he had not dealt it;|nɛvəðəlɛs, ʃiː fɛlt eɪ wuːnd, iːvən ɪf hiː had nɒt dɛlt ɪt;
104517|30-000008|it seemed to her that a mask had suddenly fallen from his face.|ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː ðat eɪ mask had sʌdənli fɔːlən fɹɒm hɪz feɪs.
104518|30-000009|He had wished to get away from her;|hiː had wɪʃt tuː ɡɛt ɐweɪ fɹɒm hɜː;
104519|30-000010|he had been angry and cruel, and said strange things, with strange looks.|hiː had biːn aŋɡɹi and kɹuːəl, and sɛd stɹeɪndʒ θɪŋz, wɪð stɹeɪndʒ lʊks.
104520|30-000011|She was smothered and stunned;|ʃiː wɒz smʌðəd and stʌnd;
104521|30-000012|she buried her head in the cushions, sobbing and talking to herself.|ʃiː bɛɹid hɜː hɛd ɪn ðə kʊʃənz, sɒbɪŋ and tɔːkɪŋ tuː hɜːsɛlf.
104523|30-000014|and then she sat there, staring before her, while the room grew darker.|and ðɛn ʃiː sat ðeə, steəɹɪŋ bɪfɔː hɜː, waɪl ðə ɹuːm ɡɹuː dɑːkə.
104524|30-000015|She said to herself that perhaps he would come back to tell her he had not meant what he said;|ʃiː sɛd tuː hɜːsɛlf ðat pəhaps hiː wʊd kʌm bak tuː tɛl hɜː hiː had nɒt mɛnt wɒt hiː sɛd;
104525|30-000016|and she listened for his ring at the door, trying to believe that this was probable.|and ʃiː lɪsənd fɔː hɪz ɹɪŋ at ðə dɔː, tɹaɪɪŋ tuː bɪliːv ðat ðɪs wɒz pɹɒbəbəl.
104526|30-000017|A long time passed, but Morris remained absent;|eɪ lɒŋ taɪm past, bʌt mɒɹɪs ɹɪmeɪnd absənt;
104527|30-000018|the shadows gathered;|ðə ʃadəʊz ɡaðəd;
104528|30-000019|the evening settled down on the meagre elegance of the light, clear-coloured room;|ðə iːvnɪŋ sɛtəld daʊn ɒn ðə miːɡə ɛlɪɡəns ɒv ðə laɪt, kliəkələd ɹuːm;
104529|30-000020|the fire went out.|ðə faɪə wɛnt aʊt.
104530|30-000021|When it had grown dark, Catherine went to the window and looked out;|wɛn ɪt had ɡɹəʊn dɑːk, kaθɹɪn wɛnt tuː ðə wɪndəʊ and lʊkt aʊt;
104532|30-000023|At last she turned away, for she saw her father come in.|at last ʃiː tɜːnd ɐweɪ, fɔː ʃiː sɔː hɜː fɑːðə kʌm ɪn.
104533|30-000024|He had seen her at the window looking out, and he stopped a moment at the bottom of the white steps, and gravely, with an air of exaggerated courtesy, lifted his hat to her.|hiː had siːn hɜː at ðə wɪndəʊ lʊkɪŋ aʊt, and hiː stɒpt eɪ məʊmənt at ðə bɒtəm ɒv ðə waɪt stɛps, and ɡɹeɪvli, wɪð an eə ɒv ɛɡzadʒəɹeɪtɪd kɜːtəsi, lɪftɪd hɪz hat tuː hɜː.
104534|30-000025|The gesture was so incongruous to the condition she was in, this stately tribute of respect to a poor girl despised and forsaken was so out of place, that the thing gave her a kind of horror, and she hurried away to her room.|ðə dʒɛstʃə wɒz səʊ ɪŋkɒŋɡɹuːəs tuː ðə kəndɪʃən ʃiː wɒz ɪn, ðɪs steɪtli tɹɪbjuːt ɒv ɹɪspɛkt tuː eɪ pʊə ɡɜːl dɪspaɪzd and fɔːseɪkən wɒz səʊ aʊt ɒv pleɪs, ðat ðə θɪŋ ɡeɪv hɜː eɪ kaɪnd ɒv hɒɹə, and ʃiː hʌɹid ɐweɪ tuː hɜː ɹuːm.
104535|30-000026|It seemed to her that she had given Morris up.|ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː ðat ʃiː had ɡɪvən mɒɹɪs ʌp.
104537|30-000028|This was a great help to her afterwards, and it served her (though never as much as she supposed) from the first.|ðɪs wɒz eɪ ɡɹeɪt hɛlp tuː hɜː aftəwədz, and ɪt sɜːvd hɜː (ðəʊ nɛvə az mʌtʃ az ʃiː səpəʊzd) fɹɒm ðə fɜːst.
104538|30-000029|On this occasion doctor Sloper was rather talkative.|ɒn ðɪs əkeɪʒən dɒktə sləʊpə wɒz ɹɑːðə tɔːkətɪv.
104539|30-000030|He told a great many stories about a wonderful poodle that he had seen at the house of an old lady whom he visited professionally.|hiː təʊld eɪ ɡɹeɪt mɛni stɔːɹiz ɐbaʊt eɪ wʌndəfəl puːdəl ðat hiː had siːn at ðə haʊs ɒv an əʊld leɪdi huːm hiː vɪzɪtɪd pɹəfɛʃənəli.
104540|30-000031|Catherine not only tried to appear to listen to the anecdotes of the poodle, but she endeavoured to interest herself in them, so as not to think of her scene with Morris.|kaθɹɪn nɒt əʊnli tɹaɪd tuː ɐpiə tuː lɪsən tuː ðə anɪkdəʊts ɒv ðə puːdəl, bʌt ʃiː ɛndɛvəd tuː ɪntɹɪst hɜːsɛlf ɪn ðɛm, səʊ az nɒt tuː θɪŋk ɒv hɜː siːn wɪð mɒɹɪs.
104541|30-000032|That perhaps was an hallucination;|ðat pəhaps wɒz an hɐluːsɪneɪʃən;
104542|30-000033|he was mistaken, she was jealous;|hiː wɒz mɪsteɪkən, ʃiː wɒz dʒɛləs;
104543|30-000034|people didn't change like that from one day to another.|piːpəl dɪdnt tʃeɪndʒ laɪk ðat fɹɒm wɒn deɪ tuː ɐnʌðə.
104544|30-000035|Then she knew that she had had doubts before -- strange suspicions, that were at once vague and acute -- and that he had been different ever since her return from Europe: whereupon she tried again to listen to her father, who told a story so remarkably well.|ðɛn ʃiː njuː ðat ʃiː had had daʊts bɪfɔː -- stɹeɪndʒ səspɪʃənz, ðat wɜː at wʌns veɪɡ and ɐkjuːt -- and ðat hiː had biːn dɪfɹənt ɛvə sɪns hɜː ɹɪtɜːn fɹɒm jʊəɹəp: weəɹəpɒn ʃiː tɹaɪd ɐɡɛn tuː lɪsən tuː hɜː fɑːðə, huː təʊld eɪ stɔːɹi səʊ ɹɪmɑːkəbli wɛl.
104545|30-000036|Afterwards she went straight to her own room;|aftəwədz ʃiː wɛnt stɹeɪt tuː hɜː əʊn ɹuːm;
104546|30-000037|it was beyond her strength to undertake to spend the evening with her aunt.|ɪt wɒz bɪjɒnd hɜː stɹɛŋθ tuː ʌndəteɪk tuː spɛnd ðə iːvnɪŋ wɪð hɜː ant.
104547|30-000038|All the evening, alone, she questioned herself.|ɔːl ðə iːvnɪŋ, ɐləʊn, ʃiː kwɛstʃənd hɜːsɛlf.
104548|30-000039|Her trouble was terrible;|hɜː tɹʌbəl wɒz tɛɹɪbəl;
104549|30-000040|but was it a thing of her imagination, engendered by an extravagant sensibility, or did it represent a clear-cut reality, and had the worst that was possible actually come to pass?|bʌt wɒz ɪt eɪ θɪŋ ɒv hɜː ɪmadʒɪneɪʃən, ɛndʒɛndəd baɪ an ɛkstɹavəɡənt sɛnsəbɪlɪti, ɔː dɪd ɪt ɹɛpɹɪzɛnt eɪ kliəkʌt ɹɪalɪti, and had ðə wɜːst ðat wɒz pɒsɪbəl aktʃuːəli kʌm tuː pas?
104550|30-000041|misess Penniman, with a degree of tact that was as unusual as it was commendable, took the line of leaving her alone.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, wɪð eɪ dɪɡɹiː ɒv takt ðat wɒz az ʌnjuːʒuːəl az ɪt wɒz kəmɛndəbəl, tʊk ðə laɪn ɒv liːvɪŋ hɜː ɐləʊn.
104551|30-000042|The truth is, that her suspicions having been aroused, she indulged a desire, natural to a timid person, that the explosion should be localised.|ðə tɹuːθ ɪz, ðat hɜː səspɪʃənz havɪŋ biːn ɐɹaʊzd, ʃiː ɪndʌldʒd eɪ dɪzaɪə, natʃəɹəl tuː eɪ tɪmɪd pɜːsən, ðat ðə ɛkspləʊʒən ʃʊd biː ləʊkəlaɪzd.
104552|30-000043|So long as the air still vibrated she kept out of the way.|səʊ lɒŋ az ðə eə stɪl vaɪbɹeɪtɪd ʃiː kɛpt aʊt ɒv ðə weɪ.
104553|30-000044|She passed and repassed Catherine's door several times in the course of the evening, as if she expected to hear a plaintive moan behind it.|ʃiː past and ɹɪpast kaθɹɪnz dɔː sɛvɹəl taɪmz ɪn ðə kɔːs ɒv ðə iːvnɪŋ, az ɪf ʃiː ɛkspɛktɪd tuː hiə eɪ pleɪntɪv məʊn bɪhaɪnd ɪt.
104554|30-000045|But the room remained perfectly still;|bʌt ðə ɹuːm ɹɪmeɪnd pɜːfɛktlɪ stɪl;
104555|30-000046|and accordingly, the last thing before retiring to her own couch, she applied for admittance.|and ɐkɔːdɪŋli, ðə last θɪŋ bɪfɔː ɹɪtaɪəɹɪŋ tuː hɜː əʊn kaʊtʃ, ʃiː ɐplaɪd fɔː ɐdmɪtəns.
104556|30-000047|Catherine was sitting up, and had a book that she pretended to be reading.|kaθɹɪn wɒz sɪtɪŋ ʌp, and had eɪ bʊk ðat ʃiː pɹɪtɛndɪd tuː biː ɹiːdɪŋ.
104557|30-000048|She had no wish to go to bed, for she had no expectation of sleeping.|ʃiː had nəʊ wɪʃ tuː ɡəʊ tuː bɛd, fɔː ʃiː had nəʊ ɛkspɪkteɪʃən ɒv sliːpɪŋ.
104558|30-000049|After misess Penniman had left her she sat up half the night, and she offered her visitor no inducement to remain.|aftə mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had lɛft hɜː ʃiː sat ʌp hɑːf ðə naɪt, and ʃiː ɒfəd hɜː vɪzɪtə nəʊ ɪndjuːsmənt tuː ɹɪmeɪn.
104559|30-000050|Her aunt came stealing in very gently, and approached her with great solemnity.|hɜː ant keɪm stiːlɪŋ ɪn vɛɹi dʒɛntli, and ɐpɹəʊtʃt hɜː wɪð ɡɹeɪt sɒlɛmnɪti.
104560|30-000051|I am afraid you are in trouble, my dear.|aɪ am ɐfɹeɪd juː ɑː ɪn tɹʌbəl, maɪ diə.
104561|30-000052|Can I do anything to help you?|kan aɪ duː ɛnɪθɪŋ tuː hɛlp juː?

104566|30-000057|Perfectly sure.|pɜːfɛktlɪ ʃʊə.

104568|30-000059|"Nothing, aunt, but kindly leave me alone," said Catherine.| "nʌθɪŋ, ant, bʌt kaɪndli liːv miː ɐləʊn," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
104569|30-000060|misess Penniman, though she had been afraid of too warm a welcome before, was now disappointed at so cold a one;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, ðəʊ ʃiː had biːn ɐfɹeɪd ɒv tuː wɔːm eɪ wɛlkʌm bɪfɔː, wɒz naʊ dɪsɐpɔɪntɪd at səʊ kəʊld eɪ wɒn;
104570|30-000061|and in relating afterwards, as she did to many persons, and with considerable variations of detail, the history of the termination of her niece's engagement, she was usually careful to mention that the young lady, on a certain occasion, had "hustled" her out of the room.|and ɪn ɹɪleɪtɪŋ aftəwədz, az ʃiː dɪd tuː mɛni pɜːsənz, and wɪð kənsɪdəɹəbəl veəɹɪeɪʃənz ɒv diːteɪl, ðə hɪstəɹi ɒv ðə tɜːmɪneɪʃən ɒv hɜː niːsɪz ɛŋɡeɪdʒmənt, ʃiː wɒz juːʒuːəli keəfəl tuː mɛnʃən ðat ðə jʌŋ leɪdi, ɒn eɪ sɜːtən əkeɪʒən, had "hʌsəld" hɜː aʊt ɒv ðə ɹuːm.
104571|30-000062|It was characteristic of misess Penniman that she related this fact, not in the least out of malignity to Catherine, whom she very sufficiently pitied, but simply from a natural disposition to embellish any subject that she touched.|ɪt wɒz kaɹɪktəɹɪstɪk ɒv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ðat ʃiː ɹɪleɪtɪd ðɪs fakt, nɒt ɪn ðə liːst aʊt ɒv məlɪɡnɪti tuː kaθɹɪn, huːm ʃiː vɛɹi səfɪʃəntli pɪtid, bʌt sɪmpli fɹɒm eɪ natʃəɹəl dɪspəzɪʃən tuː ɛmbɛlɪʃ ɛni sʌbdʒɛkt ðat ʃiː tʌtʃt.
104572|30-000063|Catherine, as I have said, sat up half the night, as if she still expected to hear Morris Townsend ring at the door.|kaθɹɪn, az aɪ hav sɛd, sat ʌp hɑːf ðə naɪt, az ɪf ʃiː stɪl ɛkspɛktɪd tuː hiə mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd ɹɪŋ at ðə dɔː.
104573|30-000064|On the morrow this expectation was less unreasonable;|ɒn ðə mɒɹəʊ ðɪs ɛkspɪkteɪʃən wɒz lɛs ʌnɹiːzənəbəl;

104577|30-000068|Fortunately for Catherine she could take refuge from her excitement, which had now become intense, in her determination that her father should see nothing of it.|fɔːtʃənətli fɔː kaθɹɪn ʃiː kʊd teɪk ɹɛfjuːdʒ fɹɒm hɜː ɛksaɪtmənt, wɪtʃ had naʊ bɪkʌm ɪntɛns, ɪn hɜː dɪtɜːmɪneɪʃən ðat hɜː fɑːðə ʃʊd siː nʌθɪŋ ɒv ɪt.

104579|30-000070|but her innocent arts were of little avail before a person of the rare perspicacity of misess Penniman.|bʌt hɜː ɪnəsənt ɑːts wɜː ɒv lɪtəl ɐveɪl bɪfɔː eɪ pɜːsən ɒv ðə ɹeə pəspɪkasɪti ɒv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
104580|30-000071|This lady easily saw that she was agitated, and if there was any agitation going forward, misess Penniman was not a person to forfeit her natural share in it.|ðɪs leɪdi iːzili sɔː ðat ʃiː wɒz adʒɪteɪtɪd, and ɪf ðeə wɒz ɛni adʒɪteɪʃən ɡəʊɪŋ fɔːwəd, mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz nɒt eɪ pɜːsən tuː fɔːfɪt hɜː natʃəɹəl ʃeə ɪn ɪt.
104581|30-000072|She returned to the charge the next evening, and requested her niece to lean upon her -- to unburden her heart.|ʃiː ɹɪtɜːnd tuː ðə tʃɑːdʒ ðə nɛkst iːvnɪŋ, and ɹɪkwɛstɪd hɜː niːs tuː liːn əpɒn hɜː -- tuː ʌnbɜːdən hɜː hɑːt.
104582|30-000073|Perhaps she should be able to explain certain things that now seemed dark, and that she knew more about than Catherine supposed.|pəhaps ʃiː ʃʊd biː eɪbəl tuː ɛkspleɪn sɜːtən θɪŋz ðat naʊ siːmd dɑːk, and ðat ʃiː njuː mɔː ɐbaʊt ðɐn kaθɹɪn səpəʊzd.
104583|30-000074|If Catherine had been frigid the night before, to-day she was haughty.|ɪf kaθɹɪn had biːn fɹɪdʒɪd ðə naɪt bɪfɔː, tədeɪ ʃiː wɒz hɔːti.

104587|30-000078|From hour to hour misess Penniman's curiosity grew.|fɹɒm aʊə tuː aʊə mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz kjʊəɹɪɒsɪti ɡɹuː.
104588|30-000079|She would have given her little finger to know what Morris had said and done, what tone he had taken, what pretext he had found.|ʃiː wʊd hav ɡɪvən hɜː lɪtəl fɪŋɡə tuː nəʊ wɒt mɒɹɪs had sɛd and dʌn, wɒt təʊn hiː had teɪkən, wɒt pɹiːtɛkst hiː had faʊnd.
104589|30-000080|She wrote to him, naturally, to request an interview;|ʃiː ɹəʊt tuː hɪm, natʃəɹəli, tuː ɹɪkwɛst an ɪntəvjuː;

104591|30-000082|Morris was not in a writing mood;|mɒɹɪs wɒz nɒt ɪn eɪ ɹaɪtɪŋ muːd;
104592|30-000083|for Catherine had addressed him two short notes which met with no acknowledgment.|fɔː kaθɹɪn had ɐdɹɛst hɪm tuː ʃɔːt nəʊts wɪtʃ mɛt wɪð nəʊ ɐknɒlɪdʒmənt.

104598|30-000089|Dear Morris, you are killing me!|diə mɒɹɪs, juː ɑː kɪlɪŋ miː!
104599|30-000090|These notes were despatched on the Friday and Saturday;|ðiːz nəʊts wɜː dɪspatʃt ɒn ðə fɹaɪdeɪ and satədeɪ;
104600|30-000091|but Saturday and Sunday passed without bringing the poor girl the satisfaction she desired.|bʌt satədeɪ and sʌndeɪ past wɪðaʊt bɹɪŋɪŋ ðə pʊə ɡɜːl ðə satɪsfakʃən ʃiː dɪzaɪəd.
104601|30-000092|Her punishment accumulated;|hɜː pʌnɪʃmənt ɐkjuːmjʊleɪtɪd;
104602|30-000093|she continued to bear it, however, with a good deal of superficial fortitude.|ʃiː kəntɪnjuːd tuː beə ɪt, haʊɛvə, wɪð eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv suːpəfɪʃəl fɔːtɪtjuːd.

104605|30-000096|"Never!" cried misess Penniman, who had bethought herself what she should say to Catherine, but was not provided with a line of defence against her brother, so that indignant negation was the only weapon in her hands.| "nɛvə!" kɹaɪd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː had bɛθɔːt hɜːsɛlf wɒt ʃiː ʃʊd seɪ tuː kaθɹɪn, bʌt wɒz nɒt pɹəvaɪdɪd wɪð eɪ laɪn ɒv dɪfɛns ɐɡɛnst hɜː bɹʌðə, səʊ ðat ɪndɪɡnənt nɪɡeɪʃən wɒz ðə əʊnli wɛpən ɪn hɜː handz.

104609|30-000100|It's a great pleasure to be in the right.|ɪts eɪ ɡɹeɪt plɛʒə tuː biː ɪn ðə ɹaɪt.

104611|30-000102|Catherine went rigidly through her usual occupations;|kaθɹɪn wɛnt ɹɪdʒɪdli θɹuː hɜː juːʒuːəl ɒkjʊpeɪʃənz;
104612|30-000103|that is, up to the point of going with her aunt to church on Sunday morning.|ðat ɪz, ʌp tuː ðə pɔɪnt ɒv ɡəʊɪŋ wɪð hɜː ant tuː tʃɜːtʃ ɒn sʌndeɪ mɔːnɪŋ.
104613|30-000104|She generally went to afternoon service as well;|ʃiː dʒɛnəɹəli wɛnt tuː aftənuːn sɜːvɪs az wɛl;
104614|30-000105|but on this occasion her courage faltered, and she begged of misess Penniman to go without her.|bʌt ɒn ðɪs əkeɪʒən hɜː kʌɹɪdʒ fɒltəd, and ʃiː bɛɡd ɒv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən tuː ɡəʊ wɪðaʊt hɜː.
104615|30-000106|"I am sure you have a secret," said misess Penniman, with great significance, looking at her rather grimly.| "aɪ am ʃʊə juː hav eɪ siːkɹɪt," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, wɪð ɡɹeɪt sɪɡnɪfɪkəns, lʊkɪŋ at hɜː ɹɑːðə ɡɹɪmli.

104617|30-000108|Catherine answered, turning away.|kaθɹɪn ansəd, tɜːnɪŋ ɐweɪ.
104618|30-000109|misess Penniman started for church;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən stɑːtɪd fɔː tʃɜːtʃ;
104619|30-000110|but before she had arrived, she stopped and turned back, and before twenty minutes had elapsed she re-entered the house, looked into the empty parlours, and then went upstairs and knocked at Catherine's door.|bʌt bɪfɔː ʃiː had ɐɹaɪvd, ʃiː stɒpt and tɜːnd bak, and bɪfɔː twɛnti mɪnɪts had ɪlapst ʃiː ɹiːɛntəd ðə haʊs, lʊkt ɪntʊ ðə ɛmpti pɑːləz, and ðɛn wɛnt ʌpsteəz and nɒkt at kaθɹɪnz dɔː.
104620|30-000111|She got no answer;|ʃiː ɡɒt nəʊ ansə;
104621|30-000112|Catherine was not in her room, and misess Penniman presently ascertained that she was not in the house.|kaθɹɪn wɒz nɒt ɪn hɜː ɹuːm, and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən pɹɛzəntli asəteɪnd ðat ʃiː wɒz nɒt ɪn ðə haʊs.
104622|30-000113|She has gone to him, she has fled!|ʃiː haz ɡɒn tuː hɪm, ʃiː haz flɛd!

104624|30-000115|But she soon perceived that Catherine had taken nothing with her -- all her personal property in her room was intact -- and then she jumped at the hypothesis that the girl had gone forth, not in tenderness, but in resentment.|bʌt ʃiː suːn pəsiːvd ðat kaθɹɪn had teɪkən nʌθɪŋ wɪð hɜː -- ɔːl hɜː pɜːsənəl pɹɒpəti ɪn hɜː ɹuːm wɒz ɪntakt -- and ðɛn ʃiː dʒʌmpt at ðə haɪpɒθəsɪs ðat ðə ɡɜːl had ɡɒn fɔːθ, nɒt ɪn tɛndənəs, bʌt ɪn ɹɪzɛntmənt.

104626|30-000117|It was in these terms that misess Penniman depicted to herself her niece's errand, which, viewed in this light, gratified her sense of the picturesque only a shade less strongly than the idea of a clandestine marriage.|ɪt wɒz ɪn ðiːz tɜːmz ðat mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən dɪpɪktɪd tuː hɜːsɛlf hɜː niːsɪz ɛɹənd, wɪtʃ, vjuːd ɪn ðɪs laɪt, ɡɹatɪfaɪd hɜː sɛns ɒv ðə pɪktʃəɹɛsk əʊnli eɪ ʃeɪd lɛs stɹɒŋli ðɐn ðə aɪdiə ɒv eɪ klandɛstɪn maɹɪdʒ.
104627|30-000118|To visit one's lover, with tears and reproaches, at his own residence, was an image so agreeable to misess Penniman's mind that she felt a sort of aesthetic disappointment at its lacking, in this case, the harmonious accompaniments of darkness and storm.|tuː vɪzɪt wɒnz lʌvə, wɪð tiəz and ɹɪpɹəʊtʃɪz, at hɪz əʊn ɹɛzɪdəns, wɒz an ɪmɪdʒ səʊ ɐɡɹiːəbəl tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz maɪnd ðat ʃiː fɛlt eɪ sɔːt ɒv iːsθɛtɪk dɪsɐpɔɪntmənt at ɪts lakɪŋ, ɪn ðɪs keɪs, ðə hɑːməʊniəs ɐkʌmpɐnɪmənts ɒv dɑːknəs and stɔːm.
104628|30-000119|A quiet Sunday afternoon appeared an inadequate setting for it;|eɪ kwaɪət sʌndeɪ aftənuːn ɐpiəd an ɪnadɪkwət sɛtɪŋ fɔː ɪt;
104629|30-000120|and, indeed, misess Penniman was quite out of humour with the conditions of the time, which passed very slowly as she sat in the front parlour in her bonnet and her cashmere shawl, awaiting Catherine's return.|and, ɪndiːd, mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz kwaɪt aʊt ɒv hjuːmə wɪð ðə kəndɪʃənz ɒv ðə taɪm, wɪtʃ past vɛɹi sləʊli az ʃiː sat ɪn ðə fɹʌnt pɑːlə ɪn hɜː bɒnɪt and hɜː kaʃmiə ʃɔːl, ɐweɪtɪŋ kaθɹɪnz ɹɪtɜːn.

104631|30-000122|She saw her -- at the window -- mount the steps, and she went to await her in the hall, where she pounced upon her as soon as she had entered the house, and drew her into the parlour, closing the door with solemnity.|ʃiː sɔː hɜː -- at ðə wɪndəʊ -- maʊnt ðə stɛps, and ʃiː wɛnt tuː ɐweɪt hɜː ɪn ðə hɔːl, weə ʃiː paʊnst əpɒn hɜː az suːn az ʃiː had ɛntəd ðə haʊs, and dɹuː hɜː ɪntʊ ðə pɑːlə, kləʊzɪŋ ðə dɔː wɪð sɒlɛmnɪti.

104653|30-000144|She was really too perverse.|ʃiː wɒz ɹiəlɪ tuː pəvɜːs.

104674|30-000165|There was an imperious brevity in the tone of this inquiry, against which misess Penniman felt bound to protest;|ðeə wɒz an ɪmpiəɹiəs bɹɛvɪti ɪn ðə təʊn ɒv ðɪs ɪŋkwaɪəɹi, ɐɡɛnst wɪtʃ mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən fɛlt baʊnd tuː pɹəʊtɛst;

104677|30-000168|she was shocked at the girl's obstinacy.|ʃiː wɒz ʃɒkt at ðə ɡɜːlz ɒbstɪnəsi.

104679|30-000170|and she turned away.|and ʃiː tɜːnd ɐweɪ.
104680|30-000171|Catherine watched her a moment in silence;|kaθɹɪn wɒtʃt hɜː eɪ məʊmənt ɪn saɪləns;
104682|30-000173|Told me what?|təʊld miː wɒt?

104684|30-000175|What are you hinting at and threatening me with?|wɒt ɑː juː hɪntɪŋ at and θɹɛtənɪŋ miː wɪð?
104685|30-000176|"Isn't it broken off?" asked misess Penniman.| "ɪsnt ɪt bɹəʊkən ɒf?" askt mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.

104692|30-000183|"What has happened between you, then?" asked her aunt, struck by the sincerity of this cry.| "wɒt haz hapənd bɪtwiːn juː, ðɛn?" askt hɜː ant, stɹʌk baɪ ðə sɪnsɛɹɪti ɒv ðɪs kɹaɪ.
104693|30-000184|For something certainly has happened.|fɔː sʌmθɪŋ sɜːtənli haz hapənd.
104694|30-000185|Nothing has happened but that I love him more and more!|nʌθɪŋ haz hapənd bʌt ðat aɪ lʌv hɪm mɔː and mɔː!
104695|30-000186|misess Penniman was silent an instant.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz saɪlənt an ɪnstənt.
104696|30-000187|I suppose that's the reason you went to see him this afternoon.|aɪ səpəʊz ðats ðə ɹiːzən juː wɛnt tuː siː hɪm ðɪs aftənuːn.
104697|30-000188|Catherine flushed as if she had been struck.|kaθɹɪn flʌʃt az ɪf ʃiː had biːn stɹʌk.

104702|30-000193|And misess Penniman moved towards the door again.|and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən muːvd təwɔːdz ðə dɔː ɐɡɛn.
104703|30-000194|But she was stopped by a sudden imploring cry from the girl.|bʌt ʃiː wɒz stɒpt baɪ eɪ sʌdən ɪmplɔːɹɪŋ kɹaɪ fɹɒm ðə ɡɜːl.
104704|30-000195|Aunt Lavinia, where has he gone?|ant lavɪniə, weə haz hiː ɡɒn?

104707|30-000198|They said he had left town.|ðeɪ sɛd hiː had lɛft taʊn.
104708|30-000199|I asked no more questions;|aɪ askt nəʊ mɔː kwɛstʃənz;
104709|30-000200|"I was ashamed," said Catherine, simply enough.| "aɪ wɒz ɐʃeɪmd," sɛd kaθɹɪn, sɪmpli ɪnʌf.
104710|30-000201|"You needn't have taken so compromising a step if you had had a little more confidence in me," misess Penniman observed, with a good deal of grandeur.| "juː niːdnt hav teɪkən səʊ kɒmpɹəmaɪzɪŋ eɪ stɛp ɪf juː had had eɪ lɪtəl mɔː kɒnfɪdəns ɪn miː," mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɒbzɜːvd, wɪð eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv ɡɹandjʊə.
104711|30-000202|Is it to New Orleans?|ɪz ɪt tuː njuː ɔːliənz?
104712|30-000203|Catherine went on irrelevantly.|kaθɹɪn wɛnt ɒn ɪɹɛlɪvəntli.
104713|30-000204|It was the first time misess Penniman had heard of New Orleans in this connexion;|ɪt wɒz ðə fɜːst taɪm mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had hɜːd ɒv njuː ɔːliənz ɪn ðɪs kənɛkʃən;

104718|30-000209|Has he agreed upon it with you?|haz hiː ɐɡɹiːd əpɒn ɪt wɪð juː?
104719|30-000210|A consummate sense of her aunt's meddlesome folly had come over her during the last five minutes, and she was sickened at the thought that misess Penniman had been let loose, as it were, upon her happiness.|eɪ kɒnsəmeɪt sɛns ɒv hɜː ants mɛdəlsʌm fɒli had kʌm əʊvə hɜː djʊəɹɪŋ ðə last faɪv mɪnɪts, and ʃiː wɒz sɪkənd at ðə θɔːt ðat mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had biːn lɛt luːs, az ɪt wɜː, əpɒn hɜː hapɪnəs.

104721|30-000212|"Is it you, then, that have changed him and made him so unnatural?" Catherine cried.| "ɪz ɪt juː, ðɛn, ðat hav tʃeɪndʒd hɪm and meɪd hɪm səʊ ʌnnatʃəɹəl?" kaθɹɪn kɹaɪd.

104725|30-000216|How could you be so wicked, so cruel?|haʊ kʊd juː biː səʊ wɪkɪd, səʊ kɹuːəl?
104726|30-000217|What have I ever done to you;|wɒt hav aɪ ɛvə dʌn tuː juː;

104732|30-000223|Catherine went on with growing vehemence, pouring out in her bitterness and in the clairvoyance of her passion (which suddenly, jumping all processes, made her judge her aunt finally and without appeal) the uneasiness which had lain for so many months upon her heart.|kaθɹɪn wɛnt ɒn wɪð ɡɹəʊɪŋ viəməns, pɔːɹɪŋ aʊt ɪn hɜː bɪtənəs and ɪn ðə kleəvɔɪəns ɒv hɜː paʃən (wɪtʃ sʌdənli, dʒʌmpɪŋ ɔːl pɹəʊsɛsɪz, meɪd hɜː dʒʌdʒ hɜː ant faɪnəli and wɪðaʊt ɐpiːl) ðə ʌniːzinəs wɪtʃ had leɪn fɔː səʊ mɛni mʌnθs əpɒn hɜː hɑːt.
104733|30-000224|misess Penniman was scared and bewildered;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz skeəd and bɪwɪldəd;
104734|30-000225|she saw no prospect of introducing her little account of the purity of Morris's motives.|ʃiː sɔː nəʊ pɹɒspɛkt ɒv ɪntɹədjuːsɪŋ hɜː lɪtəl ɐkaʊnt ɒv ðə pjʊəɹɪti ɒv mɒɹɪs məʊtɪvz.

104738|30-000229|Yes;|jɛs;

104745|30-000236|"That's better than this," said poor Catherine.| "ðats bɛtə ðɐn ðɪs," sɛd pʊə kaθɹɪn.
104746|30-000237|"You are a very ungrateful girl," Aunt Lavinia repeated.| "juː ɑː eɪ vɛɹi ʌŋɡɹeɪtfəl ɡɜːl," ant lavɪniə ɹɪpiːtɪd.
104747|30-000238|Catherine's outbreak of anger and the sense of wrong gave her, while they lasted, the satisfaction that comes from all assertion of force;|kaθɹɪnz aʊtbɹeɪk ɒv aŋɡə and ðə sɛns ɒv ɹɒŋ ɡeɪv hɜː, waɪl ðeɪ lastɪd, ðə satɪsfakʃən ðat kʌmz fɹɒm ɔːl ɐsɜːʃən ɒv fɔːs;

104757|30-000248|And misess Penniman wished indeed that she were, so that she might let him know how Catherine abused her, after all she had done.|and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɪʃt ɪndiːd ðat ʃiː wɜː, səʊ ðat ʃiː maɪt lɛt hɪm nəʊ haʊ kaθɹɪn ɐbjuːzd hɜː, aftə ɔːl ʃiː had dʌn.

104759|30-000250|By this time Catherine had become completely quiet.|baɪ ðɪs taɪm kaθɹɪn had bɪkʌm kəmpliːtli kwaɪət.
104760|30-000251|misess Penniman began again to have a glimpse of her chance for explaining.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən bɪɡan ɐɡɛn tuː hav eɪ ɡlɪmps ɒv hɜː tʃans fɔː ɛkspleɪnɪŋ.
104761|30-000252|"He shrank -- he shrank," she said.| "hiː ʃɹaŋk -- hiː ʃɹaŋk," ʃiː sɛd.

104764|30-000255|Catherine listened to this with her eyes fixed upon her aunt, and continued to gaze at her for some time afterwards.|kaθɹɪn lɪsənd tuː ðɪs wɪð hɜː aɪz fɪkst əpɒn hɜː ant, and kəntɪnjuːd tuː ɡeɪz at hɜː fɔː sʌm taɪm aftəwədz.
104765|30-000256|Did he tell you to say that?|dɪd hiː tɛl juː tuː seɪ ðat?

104774|30-000265|You doubtless think him too scrupulous.|juː daʊtləs θɪŋk hɪm tuː skɹuːpjʊləs.
104775|30-000266|So do I, but I respect his scruples.|səʊ duː aɪ, bʌt aɪ ɹɪspɛkt hɪz skɹuːpəlz.
104776|30-000267|What he asks of you is that you should do the same.|wɒt hiː asks ɒv juː ɪz ðat juː ʃʊd duː ðə seɪm.
104777|30-000268|Catherine was still gazing at her aunt, but she spoke at last, as if she had not heard or not understood her.|kaθɹɪn wɒz stɪl ɡeɪzɪŋ at hɜː ant, bʌt ʃiː spəʊk at last, az ɪf ʃiː had nɒt hɜːd ɔː nɒt ʌndəstʊd hɜː.

104786|31-000001|though she had forced herself to be calm, she preferred practising this virtue in private, and she forbore to show herself at tea -- a repast which, on Sundays, at six o'clock, took the place of dinner.|ðəʊ ʃiː had fɔːst hɜːsɛlf tuː biː kɑːm, ʃiː pɹɪfɜːd pɹaktɪsɪŋ ðɪs vɜːtʃuː ɪn pɹaɪvət, and ʃiː fɔːbɔː tuː ʃəʊ hɜːsɛlf at tiː -- eɪ ɹɪpast wɪtʃ, ɒn sʌndeɪz, at sɪks ɒklɒk, tʊk ðə pleɪs ɒv dɪnə.

104788|31-000003|Late in the evening she went with him, but without Catherine, to their sister Almond's, where, between the two ladies, Catherine's unhappy situation was discussed with a frankness that was conditioned by a good deal of mysterious reticence on misess Penniman's part.|leɪt ɪn ðə iːvnɪŋ ʃiː wɛnt wɪð hɪm, bʌt wɪðaʊt kaθɹɪn, tuː ðeə sɪstə ɒlməndz, weə, bɪtwiːn ðə tuː leɪdiz, kaθɹɪnz ʌnhapi sɪtʃuːeɪʃən wɒz dɪskʌst wɪð eɪ fɹaŋknəs ðat wɒz kəndɪʃənd baɪ eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv mɪstiəɹiəs ɹɪtɪsəns ɒn mɪsɛs pɛnɪmənz pɑːt.

104790|31-000005|misess Penniman, who was shocked at her sister's coarseness, replied that he had been actuated by the noblest of motives -- the desire not to impoverish Catherine.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː wɒz ʃɒkt at hɜː sɪstəz kɔːsnəs, ɹɪplaɪd ðat hiː had biːn aktʃuːeɪtɪd baɪ ðə nəʊblɪst ɒv məʊtɪvz -- ðə dɪzaɪə nɒt tuː ɪmpɒvəɹɪʃ kaθɹɪn.

104793|31-000008|"She says I have a genius for consolation," said misess Penniman.| "ʃiː sɛz aɪ hav eɪ dʒiːnɪəs fɔː kɒnsəleɪʃən," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.
104794|31-000009|This was the account of the matter that she gave to her sister, and it was perhaps with the consciousness of genius that, on her return that evening to Washington Square, she again presented herself for admittance at Catherine's door.|ðɪs wɒz ðə ɐkaʊnt ɒv ðə matə ðat ʃiː ɡeɪv tuː hɜː sɪstə, and ɪt wɒz pəhaps wɪð ðə kɒnʃəsnəs ɒv dʒiːnɪəs ðat, ɒn hɜː ɹɪtɜːn ðat iːvnɪŋ tuː wɒʃɪŋtən skweə, ʃiː ɐɡɛn pɹɪzɛntɪd hɜːsɛlf fɔː ɐdmɪtəns at kaθɹɪnz dɔː.
104795|31-000010|Catherine came and opened it;|kaθɹɪn keɪm and əʊpənd ɪt;
104796|31-000011|she was apparently very quiet.|ʃiː wɒz ɐpaɹəntli vɛɹi kwaɪət.
104797|31-000012|"I only want to give you a little word of advice," she said.| "aɪ əʊnli wɒnt tuː ɡɪv juː eɪ lɪtəl wɜːd ɒv ɐdvaɪs," ʃiː sɛd.
104798|31-000013|If your father asks you, say that everything is going on.|ɪf jɔː fɑːðə asks juː, seɪ ðat ɛvɹɪθɪŋ ɪz ɡəʊɪŋ ɒn.
104799|31-000014|Catherine stood there, with her hand on the knob looking at her aunt, but not asking her to come in.|kaθɹɪn stʊd ðeə, wɪð hɜː hand ɒn ðə nɒb lʊkɪŋ at hɜː ant, bʌt nɒt askɪŋ hɜː tuː kʌm ɪn.
104800|31-000015|Do you think he will ask me?|duː juː θɪŋk hiː wɪl ask miː?
104801|31-000016|I am sure he will.|aɪ am ʃʊə hiː wɪl.
104802|31-000017|He asked me just now, on our way home from your Aunt Elizabeth's.|hiː askt miː dʒʌst naʊ, ɒn aʊə weɪ həʊm fɹɒm jɔː ant ɪlɪzəbəθs.
104803|31-000018|I explained the whole thing to your Aunt Elizabeth.|aɪ ɛkspleɪnd ðə həʊl θɪŋ tuː jɔː ant ɪlɪzəbəθ.
104804|31-000019|I said to your father I know nothing about it.|aɪ sɛd tuː jɔː fɑːðə aɪ nəʊ nʌθɪŋ ɐbaʊt ɪt.
104805|31-000020|Do you think he will ask me when he sees -- when he sees -- ?|duː juː θɪŋk hiː wɪl ask miː wɛn hiː siːz -- wɛn hiː siːz -- ?
104806|31-000021|But here Catherine stopped.|bʌt hiə kaθɹɪn stɒpt.
104807|31-000022|"The more he sees the more disagreeable he will be," said her aunt.| "ðə mɔː hiː siːz ðə mɔː dɪsɐɡɹiːəbəl hiː wɪl biː," sɛd hɜː ant.
104808|31-000023|"He shall see as little as possible!" Catherine declared.| "hiː ʃal siː az lɪtəl az pɒsɪbəl!" kaθɹɪn dɪkleəd.
104809|31-000024|Tell him you are to be married.|tɛl hɪm juː ɑː tuː biː maɹid.
104810|31-000025|"So I am," said Catherine softly;| "səʊ aɪ am," sɛd kaθɹɪn sɒftli;
104811|31-000026|and she closed the door upon her aunt.|and ʃiː kləʊzd ðə dɔː əpɒn hɜː ant.
104812|31-000027|She could not have said this two days later -- for instance, on Tuesday, when she at last received a letter from Morris Townsend.|ʃiː kʊd nɒt hav sɛd ðɪs tuː deɪz leɪtə -- fɔː ɪnstəns, ɒn tjuːzdeɪ, wɛn ʃiː at last ɹɪsiːvd eɪ lɛtə fɹɒm mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
104813|31-000028|It was an epistle of considerable length, measuring five large square pages, and written at Philadelphia.|ɪt wɒz an ɪpɪsəl ɒv kənsɪdəɹəbəl lɛŋθ, mɛʒəɹɪŋ faɪv lɑːdʒ skweə peɪdʒɪz, and ɹɪtən at fɪlɐdɛlfiə.
104814|31-000029|It was an explanatory document, and it explained a great many things, chief among which were the considerations that had led the writer to take advantage of an urgent "professional" absence to try and banish from his mind the image of one whose path he had crossed only to scatter it with ruins.|ɪt wɒz an ɛksplanətəɹi dɒkjuːmənt, and ɪt ɛkspleɪnd eɪ ɡɹeɪt mɛni θɪŋz, tʃiːf ɐmʌŋ wɪtʃ wɜː ðə kənsɪdəɹeɪʃənz ðat had lɛd ðə ɹaɪtə tuː teɪk ɐdvantɪdʒ ɒv an ɜːdʒənt "pɹəfɛʃənəl" absəns tuː tɹaɪ and banɪʃ fɹɒm hɪz maɪnd ðə ɪmɪdʒ ɒv wɒn huːz paθ hiː had kɹɒst əʊnli tuː skatə ɪt wɪð ɹuːɪnz.
104815|31-000030|He ventured to expect but partial success in this attempt, but he could promise her that, whatever his failure, he would never again interpose between her generous heart and her brilliant prospects and filial duties.|hiː vɛntʃəd tuː ɛkspɛkt bʌt pɑːʃəl səksɛs ɪn ðɪs ɐtɛmpt, bʌt hiː kʊd pɹɒmɪs hɜː ðat, wɒtɛvə hɪz feɪliə, hiː wʊd nɛvə ɐɡɛn ɪntəpəʊz bɪtwiːn hɜː dʒɛnəɹəs hɑːt and hɜː bɹɪliənt pɹɒspɛkts and fɪlɪəl djuːtiz.
104816|31-000031|He closed with an intimation that his professional pursuits might compel him to travel for some months, and with the hope that when they should each have accommodated themselves to what was sternly involved in their respective positions -- even should this result not be reached for years -- they should meet as friends, as fellow-sufferers, as innocent but philosophic victims of a great social law.|hiː kləʊzd wɪð an ɪntɪmeɪʃən ðat hɪz pɹəfɛʃənəl pəsuːts maɪt kəmpɛl hɪm tuː tɹavəl fɔː sʌm mʌnθs, and wɪð ðə həʊp ðat wɛn ðeɪ ʃʊd iːtʃ hav ɐkɒmədeɪtɪd ðɛmsɛlvz tuː wɒt wɒz stɜːnli ɪnvɒlvd ɪn ðeə ɹɪspɛktɪv pəzɪʃənz -- iːvən ʃʊd ðɪs ɹɪzʌlt nɒt biː ɹiːtʃt fɔː jiəz -- ðeɪ ʃʊd miːt az fɹɛndz, az fɛləʊsʌfəɹəz, az ɪnəsənt bʌt fɪləsɒfɪk vɪktɪmz ɒv eɪ ɡɹeɪt səʊʃəl lɔː.
104817|31-000032|That her life should be peaceful and happy was the dearest wish of him who ventured still to subscribe himself her most obedient servant.|ðat hɜː laɪf ʃʊd biː piːsfəl and hapi wɒz ðə diəɹɪst wɪʃ ɒv hɪm huː vɛntʃəd stɪl tuː səbskɹaɪb hɪmsɛlf hɜː məʊst əʊbiːdiənt sɜːvənt.
104818|31-000033|The letter was beautifully written, and Catherine, who kept it for many years after this, was able, when her sense of the bitterness of its meaning and the hollowness of its tone had grown less acute, to admire its grace of expression.|ðə lɛtə wɒz bjuːtɪfəli ɹɪtən, and kaθɹɪn, huː kɛpt ɪt fɔː mɛni jiəz aftə ðɪs, wɒz eɪbəl, wɛn hɜː sɛns ɒv ðə bɪtənəs ɒv ɪts miːnɪŋ and ðə hɒləʊnəs ɒv ɪts təʊn had ɡɹəʊn lɛs ɐkjuːt, tuː ɐdmaɪə ɪts ɡɹeɪs ɒv ɛkspɹɛʃən.
104819|31-000034|At present, for a long time after she received it, all she had to help her was the determination, daily more rigid, to make no appeal to the compassion of her father.|at pɹɛzənt, fɔː eɪ lɒŋ taɪm aftə ʃiː ɹɪsiːvd ɪt, ɔːl ʃiː had tuː hɛlp hɜː wɒz ðə dɪtɜːmɪneɪʃən, deɪli mɔː ɹɪdʒɪd, tuː meɪk nəʊ ɐpiːl tuː ðə kəmpaʃən ɒv hɜː fɑːðə.
104820|31-000035|He suffered a week to elapse, and then one day, in the morning, at an hour at which she rarely saw him, he strolled into the back parlour.|hiː sʌfəd eɪ wiːk tuː ɪlaps, and ðɛn wɒn deɪ, ɪn ðə mɔːnɪŋ, at an aʊə at wɪtʃ ʃiː ɹeəli sɔː hɪm, hiː stɹəʊld ɪntʊ ðə bak pɑːlə.
104821|31-000036|He had watched his time, and he found her alone.|hiː had wɒtʃt hɪz taɪm, and hiː faʊnd hɜː ɐləʊn.
104823|31-000038|He was going out, he had on his hat and was drawing on his gloves.|hiː wɒz ɡəʊɪŋ aʊt, hiː had ɒn hɪz hat and wɒz dɹɔːɪŋ ɒn hɪz ɡlʌvz.
104824|31-000039|"It doesn't seem to me that you are treating me just now with all the consideration I deserve," he said in a moment.| "ɪt dʌzənt siːm tuː miː ðat juː ɑː tɹiːtɪŋ miː dʒʌst naʊ wɪð ɔːl ðə kənsɪdəɹeɪʃən aɪ dɪzɜːv," hiː sɛd ɪn eɪ məʊmənt.
104826|31-000041|You have apparently quite banished from your mind the request I made you at Liverpool, before we sailed;|juː hav ɐpaɹəntli kwaɪt banɪʃt fɹɒm jɔː maɪnd ðə ɹɪkwɛst aɪ meɪd juː at lɪvəpuːl, bɪfɔː wiː seɪld;

104828|31-000043|"I have not left your house!" said Catherine.| "aɪ hav nɒt lɛft jɔː haʊs!" sɛd kaθɹɪn.
104829|31-000044|But you intend to leave it, and by what you gave me to understand, your departure must be impending.|bʌt juː ɪntɛnd tuː liːv ɪt, and baɪ wɒt juː ɡeɪv miː tuː ʌndəstand, jɔː dɪpɑːtʃə mʌst biː ɪmpɛndɪŋ.

104831|31-000046|Your mind has taken up its residence with your prospective husband, and you might quite as well be lodged under the conjugal roof, for all the benefit we get from your society.|jɔː maɪnd haz teɪkən ʌp ɪts ɹɛzɪdəns wɪð jɔː pɹəspɛktɪv hʌsbənd, and juː maɪt kwaɪt az wɛl biː lɒdʒd ʌndə ðə kɒndʒuːɡəl ɹuːf, fɔː ɔːl ðə bɛnɪfɪt wiː ɡɛt fɹɒm jɔː səsaɪəti.
104832|31-000047|"I will try and be more cheerful!" said Catherine.| "aɪ wɪl tɹaɪ and biː mɔː tʃiəfəl!" sɛd kaθɹɪn.
104833|31-000048|You certainly ought to be cheerful, you ask a great deal if you are not.|juː sɜːtənli ɔːt tuː biː tʃiəfəl, juː ask eɪ ɡɹeɪt diːl ɪf juː ɑː nɒt.
104834|31-000049|To the pleasure of marrying a brilliant young man, you add that of having your own way;|tuː ðə plɛʒə ɒv maɹiɪŋ eɪ bɹɪliənt jʌŋ man, juː ad ðat ɒv havɪŋ jɔː əʊn weɪ;

104836|31-000051|Catherine got up;|kaθɹɪn ɡɒt ʌp;
104837|31-000052|she was suffocating.|ʃiː wɒz sʌfəkeɪtɪŋ.

104839|31-000054|Her father stood where he had planted himself;|hɜː fɑːðə stʊd weə hiː had plantɪd hɪmsɛlf;
104840|31-000055|she hoped he would go, but he smoothed and buttoned his gloves, and then he rested his hands upon his hips.|ʃiː həʊpt hiː wʊd ɡəʊ, bʌt hiː smuːðd and bʌtənd hɪz ɡlʌvz, and ðɛn hiː ɹɛstɪd hɪz handz əpɒn hɪz hɪps.
104841|31-000056|"It would be a convenience to me to know when I may expect to have an empty house," he went on.| "ɪt wʊd biː eɪ kənviːnɪəns tuː miː tuː nəʊ wɛn aɪ meɪ ɛkspɛkt tuː hav an ɛmpti haʊs," hiː wɛnt ɒn.

104843|31-000058|She looked at him at last, with a long silent gaze, which, in spite of her pride and her resolution, uttered part of the appeal she had tried not to make.|ʃiː lʊkt at hɪm at last, wɪð eɪ lɒŋ saɪlənt ɡeɪz, wɪtʃ, ɪn spaɪt ɒv hɜː pɹaɪd and hɜː ɹɛzəluːʃən, ʌtəd pɑːt ɒv ðə ɐpiːl ʃiː had tɹaɪd nɒt tuː meɪk.

104845|31-000060|Is it to-morrow?|ɪz ɪt təmɒɹəʊ?
104846|31-000061|Is it next week, or the week after?|ɪz ɪt nɛkst wiːk, ɔː ðə wiːk aftə?
104847|31-000062|"I shall not go away!" said Catherine.| "aɪ ʃal nɒt ɡəʊ ɐweɪ!" sɛd kaθɹɪn.
104848|31-000063|The Doctor raised his eyebrows.|ðə dɒktə ɹeɪzd hɪz aɪbɹaʊz.
104849|31-000064|Has he backed out?|haz hiː bakt aʊt?
104850|31-000065|I have broken off my engagement.|aɪ hav bɹəʊkən ɒf maɪ ɛŋɡeɪdʒmənt.
104851|31-000066|Broken it off?|bɹəʊkən ɪt ɒf?
104852|31-000067|I have asked him to leave New York, and he has gone away for a long time.|aɪ hav askt hɪm tuː liːv njuː jɔːk, and hiː haz ɡɒn ɐweɪ fɔː eɪ lɒŋ taɪm.
104853|31-000068|The Doctor was both puzzled and disappointed, but he solved his perplexity by saying to himself that his daughter simply misrepresented -- justifiably, if one would?|ðə dɒktə wɒz bəʊθ pʌzəld and dɪsɐpɔɪntɪd, bʌt hiː sɒlvd hɪz pəplɛksɪti baɪ seɪɪŋ tuː hɪmsɛlf ðat hɪz dɔːtə sɪmpli mɪsɹɛpɹɪzɛntɪd -- dʒʌstɪfaɪəbli, ɪf wɒn wʊd?
104854|31-000069|but nevertheless misrepresented -- the facts;|bʌt nɛvəðəlɛs mɪsɹɛpɹɪzɛntɪd -- ðə fakts;
104855|31-000070|and he eased off his disappointment, which was that of a man losing a chance for a little triumph that he had rather counted on, by a few words that he uttered aloud.|and hiː iːzd ɒf hɪz dɪsɐpɔɪntmənt, wɪtʃ wɒz ðat ɒv eɪ man luːzɪŋ eɪ tʃans fɔː eɪ lɪtəl tɹaɪʌmf ðat hiː had ɹɑːðə kaʊntɪd ɒn, baɪ eɪ fjuː wɜːdz ðat hiː ʌtəd ɐlaʊd.
104856|31-000071|How does he take his dismissal?|haʊ dʌz hiː teɪk hɪz dɪsmɪsəl?
104857|31-000072|"I don't know!" said Catherine, less ingeniously than she had hitherto spoken.| "aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ!" sɛd kaθɹɪn, lɛs ɪndʒiːniəsli ðɐn ʃiː had hɪðətuː spəʊkən.
104858|31-000073|You mean you don't care?|juː miːn juː dəʊnt keə?

104860|32-000001|our story has hitherto moved with very short steps, but as it approaches its termination it must take a long stride.|aʊə stɔːɹi haz hɪðətuː muːvd wɪð vɛɹi ʃɔːt stɛps, bʌt az ɪt ɐpɹəʊtʃɪz ɪts tɜːmɪneɪʃən ɪt mʌst teɪk eɪ lɒŋ stɹaɪd.
104861|32-000002|As time went on, it might have appeared to the Doctor that his daughter's account of her rupture with Morris Townsend, mere bravado as he had deemed it, was in some degree justified by the sequel.|az taɪm wɛnt ɒn, ɪt maɪt hav ɐpiəd tuː ðə dɒktə ðat hɪz dɔːtəz ɐkaʊnt ɒv hɜː ɹʌptʃə wɪð mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd, miə bɹavɑːdəʊ az hiː had diːmd ɪt, wɒz ɪn sʌm dɪɡɹiː dʒʌstɪfaɪd baɪ ðə siːkwəl.
104862|32-000003|Morris remained as rigidly and unremittingly absent as if he had died of a broken heart, and Catherine had apparently buried the memory of this fruitless episode as deep as if it had terminated by her own choice.|mɒɹɪs ɹɪmeɪnd az ɹɪdʒɪdli and ʌnɹiːmɪtɪŋli absənt az ɪf hiː had daɪd ɒv eɪ bɹəʊkən hɑːt, and kaθɹɪn had ɐpaɹəntli bɛɹid ðə mɛməɹi ɒv ðɪs fɹuːtləs ɛpɪsəʊd az diːp az ɪf ɪt had tɜːmɪneɪtɪd baɪ hɜː əʊn tʃɔɪs.
104863|32-000004|We know that she had been deeply and incurably wounded, but the Doctor had no means of knowing it.|wiː nəʊ ðat ʃiː had biːn diːpli and ɪŋkjʊəɹəbli wuːndɪd, bʌt ðə dɒktə had nəʊ miːnz ɒv nəʊɪŋ ɪt.
104864|32-000005|He was certainly curious about it, and would have given a good deal to discover the exact truth;|hiː wɒz sɜːtənli kjʊəɹiəs ɐbaʊt ɪt, and wʊd hav ɡɪvən eɪ ɡʊd diːl tuː dɪskʌvə ðə ɛɡzakt tɹuːθ;
104865|32-000006|but it was his punishment that he never knew -- his punishment, I mean, for the abuse of sarcasm in his relations with his daughter.|bʌt ɪt wɒz hɪz pʌnɪʃmənt ðat hiː nɛvə njuː -- hɪz pʌnɪʃmənt, aɪ miːn, fɔː ðə ɐbjuːs ɒv sɑːkazəm ɪn hɪz ɹɪleɪʃənz wɪð hɪz dɔːtə.
104866|32-000007|There was a good deal of effective sarcasm in her keeping him in the dark, and the rest of the world conspired with her, in this sense, to be sarcastic.|ðeə wɒz eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv ɪfɛktɪv sɑːkazəm ɪn hɜː kiːpɪŋ hɪm ɪn ðə dɑːk, and ðə ɹɛst ɒv ðə wɜːld kənspaɪəd wɪð hɜː, ɪn ðɪs sɛns, tuː biː sɑːkastɪk.
104867|32-000008|misess Penniman told him nothing, partly because he never questioned her -- he made too light of misess Penniman for that -- and partly because she flattered herself that a tormenting reserve, and a serene profession of ignorance, would avenge her for his theory that she had meddled in the matter.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən təʊld hɪm nʌθɪŋ, pɑːtli bɪkɒz hiː nɛvə kwɛstʃənd hɜː -- hiː meɪd tuː laɪt ɒv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən fɔː ðat -- and pɑːtli bɪkɒz ʃiː flatəd hɜːsɛlf ðat eɪ tɔːmɛntɪŋ ɹɪzɜːv, and eɪ səɹiːn pɹəfɛʃən ɒv ɪɡnəɹəns, wʊd ɐvɛndʒ hɜː fɔː hɪz θiəɹi ðat ʃiː had mɛdəld ɪn ðə matə.

104869|32-000010|She simply knew that her brother's engagement was broken off, and now that Miss Sloper was out of danger she preferred not to bear witness in any way against Morris.|ʃiː sɪmpli njuː ðat hɜː bɹʌðəz ɛŋɡeɪdʒmənt wɒz bɹəʊkən ɒf, and naʊ ðat mɪs sləʊpə wɒz aʊt ɒv deɪndʒə ʃiː pɹɪfɜːd nɒt tuː beə wɪtnəs ɪn ɛni weɪ ɐɡɛnst mɒɹɪs.

104877|32-000018|Even, however, had she been able to narrate to him the private history of his daughter's unhappy love affair, it would have given her a certain comfort to leave him in ignorance;|iːvən, haʊɛvə, had ʃiː biːn eɪbəl tuː nɐɹeɪt tuː hɪm ðə pɹaɪvət hɪstəɹi ɒv hɪz dɔːtəz ʌnhapi lʌv ɐfeə, ɪt wʊd hav ɡɪvən hɜː eɪ sɜːtən kʌmfət tuː liːv hɪm ɪn ɪɡnəɹəns;
104879|32-000020|She had guessed for herself that Catherine had been cruelly jilted -- she knew nothing from misess Penniman, for misess Penniman had not ventured to lay the famous explanation of Morris's motives before misess Almond, though she had thought it good enough for Catherine -- and she pronounced her brother too consistently indifferent to what the poor creature must have suffered and must still be suffering.|ʃiː had ɡɛst fɔː hɜːsɛlf ðat kaθɹɪn had biːn kɹuːəli dʒɪltɪd -- ʃiː njuː nʌθɪŋ fɹɒm mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, fɔː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had nɒt vɛntʃəd tuː leɪ ðə feɪməs ɛksplɐneɪʃən ɒv mɒɹɪs məʊtɪvz bɪfɔː mɪsɛs ɒlmənd, ðəʊ ʃiː had θɔːt ɪt ɡʊd ɪnʌf fɔː kaθɹɪn -- and ʃiː pɹənaʊnst hɜː bɹʌðə tuː kənsɪstəntli ɪndɪfɹənt tuː wɒt ðə pʊə kɹiːtʃə mʌst hav sʌfəd and mʌst stɪl biː sʌfəɹɪŋ.

104882|32-000023|She was not to be pitied for that, and to pretend to condole with her would have been to make concessions to the idea that she had ever had a right to think of Morris.|ʃiː wɒz nɒt tuː biː pɪtid fɔː ðat, and tuː pɹɪtɛnd tuː kəndəʊl wɪð hɜː wʊd hav biːn tuː meɪk kənsɛʃənz tuː ðə aɪdiə ðat ʃiː had ɛvə had eɪ ɹaɪt tuː θɪŋk ɒv mɒɹɪs.

104886|32-000027|To this misess Almond more than once replied that if Catherine had got rid of her incongruous lover, she deserved the credit of it, and that to bring herself to her father's enlightened view of the matter must have cost her an effort that he was bound to appreciate.|tuː ðɪs mɪsɛs ɒlmənd mɔː ðɐn wʌns ɹɪplaɪd ðat ɪf kaθɹɪn had ɡɒt ɹɪd ɒv hɜː ɪŋkɒŋɡɹuːəs lʌvə, ʃiː dɪzɜːvd ðə kɹɛdɪt ɒv ɪt, and ðat tuː bɹɪŋ hɜːsɛlf tuː hɜː fɑːðəz ɛnlaɪtənd vjuː ɒv ðə matə mʌst hav kɒst hɜː an ɛfət ðat hiː wɒz baʊnd tuː ɐpɹiːʃɪeɪt.

104888|32-000029|There is not the smallest probability that, after having been as obstinate as a mule for two years, she suddenly became amenable to reason.|ðeə ɪz nɒt ðə smɔːlɪst pɹɒbəbɪlɪti ðat, aftə havɪŋ biːn az ɒbstɪnət az eɪ mjuːl fɔː tuː jiəz, ʃiː sʌdənli bɪkeɪm ɐmiːnəbəl tuː ɹiːzən.

104925|32-000066|"It is interesting to know that you accuse your only daughter of being the vilest of hypocrites," said misess Almond.| "ɪt ɪz ɪntɹɪstɪŋ tuː nəʊ ðat juː ɐkjuːz jɔː əʊnli dɔːtə ɒv biːɪŋ ðə vaɪlɪst ɒv hɪpəkɹɪts," sɛd mɪsɛs ɒlmənd.

104930|32-000071|The Doctor's idea that the thing was a "blind" had its intermissions and revivals;|ðə dɒktəz aɪdiə ðat ðə θɪŋ wɒz eɪ "blaɪnd" had ɪts ɪntəmɪʃənz and ɹɪvaɪvəlz;

104934|32-000075|He was obliged to recognise the fact that if the two young people were waiting for him to get out of the way, they were at least waiting very patiently.|hiː wɒz əblaɪdʒd tuː ɹɛkəɡnaɪz ðə fakt ðat ɪf ðə tuː jʌŋ piːpəl wɜː weɪtɪŋ fɔː hɪm tuː ɡɛt aʊt ɒv ðə weɪ, ðeɪ wɜː at liːst weɪtɪŋ vɛɹi peɪʃəntli.

104954|32-000095|In fact he worried rather more than appeared, and there were considerable periods during which he felt sure that Morris Townsend was hidden behind some door.|ɪn fakt hiː wʌɹid ɹɑːðə mɔː ðɐn ɐpiəd, and ðeə wɜː kənsɪdəɹəbəl piəɹɪədz djʊəɹɪŋ wɪtʃ hiː fɛlt ʃʊə ðat mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd wɒz hɪdən bɪhaɪnd sʌm dɔː.

104964|32-000105|Nothing could ever undo the wrong or cure the pain that Morris had inflicted on her, and nothing could ever make her feel towards her father as she felt in her younger years.|nʌθɪŋ kʊd ɛvə ʌnduː ðə ɹɒŋ ɔː kjʊə ðə peɪn ðat mɒɹɪs had ɪnflɪktɪd ɒn hɜː, and nʌθɪŋ kʊd ɛvə meɪk hɜː fiːl təwɔːdz hɜː fɑːðə az ʃiː fɛlt ɪn hɜː jʌŋɡə jiəz.
104965|32-000106|There was something dead in her life, and her duty was to try and fill the void.|ðeə wɒz sʌmθɪŋ dɛd ɪn hɜː laɪf, and hɜː djuːti wɒz tuː tɹaɪ and fɪl ðə vɔɪd.
104966|32-000107|Catherine recognised this duty to the utmost;|kaθɹɪn ɹɛkəɡnaɪzd ðɪs djuːti tuː ðə ʌtməʊst;
104967|32-000108|she had a great disapproval of brooding and moping.|ʃiː had eɪ ɡɹeɪt dɪsɐpɹuːvəl ɒv bɹuːdɪŋ and məʊpɪŋ.
104968|32-000109|She had, of course, no faculty for quenching memory in dissipation;|ʃiː had, ɒv kɔːs, nəʊ fakəlti fɔː kwɛntʃɪŋ mɛməɹi ɪn dɪsɪpeɪʃən;
104969|32-000110|but she mingled freely in the usual gaieties of the town, and she became at last an inevitable figure at all respectable entertainments.|bʌt ʃiː mɪŋɡəld fɹiːli ɪn ðə juːʒuːəl ɡeɪətiz ɒv ðə taʊn, and ʃiː bɪkeɪm at last an ɪnɛvɪtəbəl fɪɡə at ɔːl ɹɪspɛktəbəl ɛntəteɪnmənts.
104970|32-000111|She was greatly liked, and as time went on she grew to be a sort of kindly maiden aunt to the younger portion of society.|ʃiː wɒz ɡɹeɪtli laɪkt, and az taɪm wɛnt ɒn ʃiː ɡɹuː tuː biː eɪ sɔːt ɒv kaɪndli meɪdən ant tuː ðə jʌŋɡə pɔːʃən ɒv səsaɪəti.
104971|32-000112|Young girls were apt to confide to her their love affairs (which they never did to misess Penniman), and young men to be fond of her without knowing why.|jʌŋ ɡɜːlz wɜː apt tuː kənfaɪd tuː hɜː ðeə lʌv ɐfeəz (wɪtʃ ðeɪ nɛvə dɪd tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən), and jʌŋ mɛn tuː biː fɒnd ɒv hɜː wɪðaʊt nəʊɪŋ waɪ.
104972|32-000113|She developed a few harmless eccentricities;|ʃiː dɪvɛləpt eɪ fjuː hɑːmləs ɛksəntɹɪsɪtiz;
104973|32-000114|her habits, once formed, were rather stiffly maintained;|hɜː habɪts, wʌns fɔːmd, wɜː ɹɑːðə stɪfli meɪnteɪnd;
104974|32-000115|her opinions, on all moral and social matters, were extremely conservative;|hɜː əpɪniənz, ɒn ɔːl mɒɹəl and səʊʃəl matəz, wɜː ɛkstɹiːmli kənsɜːvətɪv;
104975|32-000116|and before she was forty she was regarded as an old-fashioned person, and an authority on customs that had passed away.|and bɪfɔː ʃiː wɒz fɔːti ʃiː wɒz ɹɪɡɑːdɪd az an əʊldfaʃənd pɜːsən, and an ɐθɒɹɪti ɒn kʌstəmz ðat had past ɐweɪ.
104976|32-000117|misess Penniman, in comparison, was quite a girlish figure;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, ɪn kəmpaɹɪsən, wɒz kwaɪt eɪ ɡɜːlɪʃ fɪɡə;
104977|32-000118|she grew younger as she advanced in life.|ʃiː ɡɹuː jʌŋɡə az ʃiː ɐdvanst ɪn laɪf.
104978|32-000119|She lost none of her relish for beauty and mystery, but she had little opportunity to exercise it.|ʃiː lɒst nʌn ɒv hɜː ɹɛlɪʃ fɔː bjuːti and mɪstəɹi, bʌt ʃiː had lɪtəl ɒpətjuːnɪti tuː ɛksəsaɪz ɪt.
104979|32-000120|With Catherine's later wooers she failed to establish relations as intimate as those which had given her so many interesting hours in the society of Morris Townsend.|wɪð kaθɹɪnz leɪtə wuːəz ʃiː feɪld tuː ɪstablɪʃ ɹɪleɪʃənz az ɪntɪmət az ðəʊz wɪtʃ had ɡɪvən hɜː səʊ mɛni ɪntɹɪstɪŋ aʊəz ɪn ðə səsaɪəti ɒv mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
104980|32-000121|These gentlemen had an indefinable mistrust of her good offices, and they never talked to her about Catherine's charms.|ðiːz dʒɛntəlmən had an ɪndɪfaɪnəbəl mɪstɹʌst ɒv hɜː ɡʊd ɒfɪsɪz, and ðeɪ nɛvə tɔːkt tuː hɜː ɐbaʊt kaθɹɪnz tʃɑːmz.
104981|32-000122|Her ringlets, her buckles and bangles, glistened more brightly with each succeeding year, and she remained quite the same officious and imaginative misess Penniman, and the odd mixture of impetuosity and circumspection, that we have hitherto known.|hɜː ɹɪŋɡlɪts, hɜː bʌkəlz and baŋɡəlz, ɡlɪsənd mɔː bɹaɪtli wɪð iːtʃ səksiːdɪŋ jiə, and ʃiː ɹɪmeɪnd kwaɪt ðə seɪm əfɪʃəs and ɪmadʒɪnətɪv mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, and ðə ɒd mɪkstʃə ɒv ɪmpɛtjuːɒsɪti and sɜːkəmspɛkʃən, ðat wiː hav hɪðətuː nəʊn.
104982|32-000123|As regards one point, however, her circumspection prevailed, and she must be given due credit for it.|az ɹɪɡɑːdz wɒn pɔɪnt, haʊɛvə, hɜː sɜːkəmspɛkʃən pɹɪveɪld, and ʃiː mʌst biː ɡɪvən djuː kɹɛdɪt fɔː ɪt.
104983|32-000124|For upwards of seventeen years she never mentioned Morris Townsend's name to her niece.|fɔː ʌpwədz ɒv sɛvəntiːn jiəz ʃiː nɛvə mɛnʃənd mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛndz neɪm tuː hɜː niːs.
104984|33-000001|little by little doctor Sloper had retired from his profession;|lɪtəl baɪ lɪtəl dɒktə sləʊpə had ɹɪtaɪəd fɹɒm hɪz pɹəfɛʃən;
104985|33-000002|he visited only those patients in whose symptoms he recognised a certain originality.|hiː vɪzɪtɪd əʊnli ðəʊz peɪʃənts ɪn huːz sɪmptəmz hiː ɹɛkəɡnaɪzd eɪ sɜːtən əɹɪdʒɪnalɪti.
104986|33-000003|He went again to Europe, and remained two years;|hiː wɛnt ɐɡɛn tuː jʊəɹəp, and ɹɪmeɪnd tuː jiəz;
104987|33-000004|Catherine went with him, and on this occasion misess Penniman was of the party.|kaθɹɪn wɛnt wɪð hɪm, and ɒn ðɪs əkeɪʒən mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz ɒv ðə pɑːti.
104988|33-000005|Europe apparently had few surprises for misess Penniman, who frequently remarked, in the most romantic sites -- "You know I am very familiar with all this."|jʊəɹəp ɐpaɹəntli had fjuː səpɹaɪzɪz fɔː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː fɹiːkwəntli ɹɪmɑːkt, ɪn ðə məʊst ɹəʊmantɪk saɪts -- "juː nəʊ aɪ am vɛɹi fəmɪliə wɪð ɔːl ðɪs."
104989|33-000006|It should be added that such remarks were usually not addressed to her brother, or yet to her niece, but to fellow-tourists who happened to be at hand, or even to the cicerone or the goat-herd in the foreground.|ɪt ʃʊd biː adɪd ðat sʌtʃ ɹɪmɑːks wɜː juːʒuːəli nɒt ɐdɹɛst tuː hɜː bɹʌðə, ɔː jɛt tuː hɜː niːs, bʌt tuː fɛləʊtʊəɹɪsts huː hapənd tuː biː at hand, ɔː iːvən tuː ðə saɪsɹəʊn ɔː ðə ɡəʊðɜːd ɪn ðə fɔːɡɹaʊnd.
104990|33-000007|One day, after his return from Europe, the Doctor said something to his daughter that made her start -- it seemed to come from so far out of the past.|wɒn deɪ, aftə hɪz ɹɪtɜːn fɹɒm jʊəɹəp, ðə dɒktə sɛd sʌmθɪŋ tuː hɪz dɔːtə ðat meɪd hɜː stɑːt -- ɪt siːmd tuː kʌm fɹɒm səʊ fɑː aʊt ɒv ðə past.
104991|33-000008|I should like you to promise me something before I die.|aɪ ʃʊd laɪk juː tuː pɹɒmɪs miː sʌmθɪŋ bɪfɔː aɪ daɪ.
104992|33-000009|"Why do you talk about your dying?" she asked.| "waɪ duː juː tɔːk ɐbaʊt jɔː daɪɪŋ?" ʃiː askt.
104993|33-000010|Because I am sixty-eight years old.|bɪkɒz aɪ am sɪkstɪeɪt jiəz əʊld.
104994|33-000011|"I hope you will live a long time," said Catherine.| "aɪ həʊp juː wɪl laɪv eɪ lɒŋ taɪm," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
104995|33-000012|I hope I shall!|aɪ həʊp aɪ ʃal!
104996|33-000013|But some day I shall take a bad cold, and then it will not matter much what any one hopes.|bʌt sʌm deɪ aɪ ʃal teɪk eɪ bad kəʊld, and ðɛn ɪt wɪl nɒt matə mʌtʃ wɒt ɛni wɒn həʊps.
104997|33-000014|That will be the manner of my exit, and when it takes place, remember I told you so.|ðat wɪl biː ðə manə ɒv maɪ ɛɡzɪt, and wɛn ɪt teɪks pleɪs, ɹɪmɛmbə aɪ təʊld juː səʊ.
104998|33-000015|Promise me not to marry Morris Townsend after I am gone.|pɹɒmɪs miː nɒt tuː maɹi mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd aftə aɪ am ɡɒn.
104999|33-000016|This was what made Catherine start, as I have said;|ðɪs wɒz wɒt meɪd kaθɹɪn stɑːt, az aɪ hav sɛd;
105000|33-000017|but her start was a silent one, and for some moments she said nothing.|bʌt hɜː stɑːt wɒz eɪ saɪlənt wɒn, and fɔː sʌm məʊmənts ʃiː sɛd nʌθɪŋ.
105001|33-000018|"Why do you speak of him?" she asked at last.| "waɪ duː juː spiːk ɒv hɪm?" ʃiː askt at last.
105002|33-000019|You challenge everything I say.|juː tʃalɪndʒ ɛvɹɪθɪŋ aɪ seɪ.
105003|33-000020|I speak of him because he's a topic, like any other.|aɪ spiːk ɒv hɪm bɪkɒz hiːz eɪ tɒpɪk, laɪk ɛni ʌðə.
105004|33-000021|He's to be seen, like any one else, and he is still looking for a wife -- having had one and got rid of her, I don't know by what means.|hiːz tuː biː siːn, laɪk ɛni wɒn ɛls, and hiː ɪz stɪl lʊkɪŋ fɔː eɪ waɪf -- havɪŋ had wɒn and ɡɒt ɹɪd ɒv hɜː, aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ baɪ wɒt miːnz.
105005|33-000022|He has lately been in New York, and at your cousin Marian's house;|hiː haz leɪtli biːn ɪn njuː jɔːk, and at jɔː kʌzən mɐɹiːənz haʊs;
105006|33-000023|your Aunt Elizabeth saw him there.|jɔː ant ɪlɪzəbəθ sɔː hɪm ðeə.
105007|33-000024|"They neither of them told me," said Catherine.| "ðeɪ naɪðə ɒv ðɛm təʊld miː," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105008|33-000025|That's their merit;|ðats ðeə mɛɹɪt;
105009|33-000026|it's not yours.|ɪts nɒt jɔːz.
105010|33-000027|He has grown fat and bald, and he has not made his fortune.|hiː haz ɡɹəʊn fat and bɔːld, and hiː haz nɒt meɪd hɪz fɔːtʃuːn.
105011|33-000028|But I can't trust those facts alone to steel your heart against him, and that's why I ask you to promise.|bʌt aɪ kant tɹʌst ðəʊz fakts ɐləʊn tuː stiːl jɔː hɑːt ɐɡɛnst hɪm, and ðats waɪ aɪ ask juː tuː pɹɒmɪs.
105012|33-000029|"Fat and bald": these words presented a strange image to Catherine's mind, out of which the memory of the most beautiful young man in the world had never faded.| "fat and bɔːld": ðiːz wɜːdz pɹɪzɛntɪd eɪ stɹeɪndʒ ɪmɪdʒ tuː kaθɹɪnz maɪnd, aʊt ɒv wɪtʃ ðə mɛməɹi ɒv ðə məʊst bjuːtifəl jʌŋ man ɪn ðə wɜːld had nɛvə feɪdɪd.
105013|33-000030|"I don't think you understand," she said.| "aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk juː ʌndəstand," ʃiː sɛd.
105014|33-000031|I very seldom think of mister Townsend.|aɪ vɛɹi sɛldəm θɪŋk ɒv mɪstə taʊnsɛnd.

105016|33-000033|Promise me, after my death, to do the same.|pɹɒmɪs miː, aftə maɪ dɛθ, tuː duː ðə seɪm.
105017|33-000034|Again, for some moments, Catherine was silent;|ɐɡɛn, fɔː sʌm məʊmənts, kaθɹɪn wɒz saɪlənt;
105018|33-000035|her father's request deeply amazed her;|hɜː fɑːðəz ɹɪkwɛst diːpli ɐmeɪzd hɜː;
105019|33-000036|it opened an old wound and made it ache afresh.|ɪt əʊpənd an əʊld wuːnd and meɪd ɪt eɪk ɐfɹɛʃ.
105020|33-000037|"I don't think I can promise that," she answered.| "aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk aɪ kan pɹɒmɪs ðat," ʃiː ansəd.
105021|33-000038|"It would be a great satisfaction," said her father.| "ɪt wʊd biː eɪ ɡɹeɪt satɪsfakʃən," sɛd hɜː fɑːðə.
105022|33-000039|You don't understand.|juː dəʊnt ʌndəstand.
105023|33-000040|I can't promise that.|aɪ kant pɹɒmɪs ðat.
105024|33-000041|The Doctor was silent a minute.|ðə dɒktə wɒz saɪlənt eɪ mɪnɪt.
105025|33-000042|I ask you for a particular reason.|aɪ ask juː fɔː eɪ pətɪkjʊlə ɹiːzən.
105026|33-000043|I am altering my will.|aɪ am ɒltəɹɪŋ maɪ wɪl.
105027|33-000044|This reason failed to strike Catherine;|ðɪs ɹiːzən feɪld tuː stɹaɪk kaθɹɪn;
105028|33-000045|and indeed she scarcely understood it.|and ɪndiːd ʃiː skeəsli ʌndəstʊd ɪt.
105029|33-000046|All her feelings were merged in the sense that he was trying to treat her as he had treated her years before.|ɔːl hɜː fiːlɪŋz wɜː mɜːdʒd ɪn ðə sɛns ðat hiː wɒz tɹaɪɪŋ tuː tɹiːt hɜː az hiː had tɹiːtɪd hɜː jiəz bɪfɔː.
105030|33-000047|She had suffered from it then;|ʃiː had sʌfəd fɹɒm ɪt ðɛn;

105032|33-000049|She had been so humble in her youth that she could now afford to have a little pride, and there was something in this request, and in her father's thinking himself so free to make it, that seemed an injury to her dignity.|ʃiː had biːn səʊ hʌmbəl ɪn hɜː juːθ ðat ʃiː kʊd naʊ ɐfɔːd tuː hav eɪ lɪtəl pɹaɪd, and ðeə wɒz sʌmθɪŋ ɪn ðɪs ɹɪkwɛst, and ɪn hɜː fɑːðəz θɪŋkɪŋ hɪmsɛlf səʊ fɹiː tuː meɪk ɪt, ðat siːmd an ɪndʒəɹi tuː hɜː dɪɡnɪti.
105033|33-000050|Poor Catherine's dignity was not aggressive;|pʊə kaθɹɪnz dɪɡnɪti wɒz nɒt ɐɡɹɛsɪv;
105034|33-000051|it never sat in state;|ɪt nɛvə sat ɪn steɪt;

105036|33-000053|Her father had pushed very far.|hɜː fɑːðə had pʊʃt vɛɹi fɑː.
105037|33-000054|"I can't promise," she simply repeated.| "aɪ kant pɹɒmɪs," ʃiː sɪmpli ɹɪpiːtɪd.
105038|33-000055|"You are very obstinate," said the Doctor.| "juː ɑː vɛɹi ɒbstɪnət," sɛd ðə dɒktə.
105039|33-000056|I don't think you understand.|aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk juː ʌndəstand.
105040|33-000057|Please explain, then.|pliːz ɛkspleɪn, ðɛn.
105041|33-000058|"I can't explain," said Catherine.| "aɪ kant ɛkspleɪn," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105042|33-000059|And I can't promise.|and aɪ kant pɹɒmɪs.
105043|33-000060|"Upon my word," her father explained, "I had no idea how obstinate you are!"| "əpɒn maɪ wɜːd," hɜː fɑːðə ɛkspleɪnd, "aɪ had nəʊ aɪdiə haʊ ɒbstɪnət juː ɑː!"
105044|33-000061|She knew herself that she was obstinate, and it gave her a certain joy.|ʃiː njuː hɜːsɛlf ðat ʃiː wɒz ɒbstɪnət, and ɪt ɡeɪv hɜː eɪ sɜːtən dʒɔɪ.
105045|33-000062|She was now a middle-aged woman.|ʃiː wɒz naʊ eɪ mɪdəlɪdʒd wʊmən.
105046|33-000063|About a year after this, the accident that the Doctor had spoken of occurred;|ɐbaʊt eɪ jiə aftə ðɪs, ðə aksɪdənt ðat ðə dɒktə had spəʊkən ɒv əkɜːd;

105048|33-000065|Driving out to Bloomingdale one April day to see a patient of unsound mind, who was confined in a private asylum for the insane, and whose family greatly desired a medical opinion from an eminent source, he was caught in a spring shower, and being in a buggy, without a hood, he found himself soaked to the skin.|dɹaɪvɪŋ aʊt tuː bluːmɪŋdeɪl wɒn eɪpɹəl deɪ tuː siː eɪ peɪʃənt ɒv ʌnsaʊnd maɪnd, huː wɒz kənfaɪnd ɪn eɪ pɹaɪvət ɐsaɪləm fɔː ðə ɪnseɪn, and huːz famɪli ɡɹeɪtli dɪzaɪəd eɪ mɛdɪkəl əpɪniən fɹɒm an ɛmɪnənt sɔːs, hiː wɒz kɔːt ɪn eɪ spɹɪŋ ʃaʊə, and biːɪŋ ɪn eɪ bʌɡi, wɪðaʊt eɪ hʊd, hiː faʊnd hɪmsɛlf səʊkt tuː ðə skɪn.

105060|33-000077|He died after three weeks' illness, during which misess Penniman, as well as his daughter, had been assiduous at his bedside.|hiː daɪd aftə θɹiː wiːks ɪlnəs, djʊəɹɪŋ wɪtʃ mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, az wɛl az hɪz dɔːtə, had biːn ɐsɪdjuːəs at hɪz bɛdsaɪd.
105061|33-000078|On his will being opened after a decent interval, it was found to consist of two portions.|ɒn hɪz wɪl biːɪŋ əʊpənd aftə eɪ diːsənt ɪntəvəl, ɪt wɒz faʊnd tuː kənsɪst ɒv tuː pɔːʃənz.
105062|33-000079|The first of these dated from ten years back, and consisted of a series of dispositions by which he left the great mass of property to his daughter, with becoming legacies to his two sisters.|ðə fɜːst ɒv ðiːz deɪtɪd fɹɒm tɛn jiəz bak, and kənsɪstɪd ɒv eɪ siəɹiz ɒv dɪspəzɪʃənz baɪ wɪtʃ hiː lɛft ðə ɡɹeɪt mas ɒv pɹɒpəti tuː hɪz dɔːtə, wɪð bɪkʌmɪŋ lɛɡəsiz tuː hɪz tuː sɪstəz.
105063|33-000080|The second was a codicil, of recent origin, maintaining the annuities to misess Penniman and misess Almond, but reducing Catherine's share to a fifth of what he had first bequeathed her.|ðə sɛkənd wɒz eɪ kəʊdɪsɪl, ɒv ɹiːsənt ɒɹɪdʒɪn, meɪnteɪnɪŋ ðə ɐnjuːɪtiz tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən and mɪsɛs ɒlmənd, bʌt ɹɪdjuːsɪŋ kaθɹɪnz ʃeə tuː eɪ fɪfθ ɒv wɒt hiː had fɜːst bɪkwiːðd hɜː.
105064|33-000081|"She is amply provided for from her mother's side," the document ran, "never having spent more than a fraction of her income from this source;"| "ʃiː ɪz amplɪ pɹəvaɪdɪd fɔː fɹɒm hɜː mʌðəz saɪd," ðə dɒkjuːmənt ɹan, "nɛvə havɪŋ spɛnt mɔː ðɐn eɪ fɹakʃən ɒv hɜː ɪŋkʌm fɹɒm ðɪs sɔːs;"
105065|33-000082|so that her fortune is already more than sufficient to attract those unscrupulous adventurers whom she has given me reason to believe that she persists in regarding as an interesting class.|səʊ ðat hɜː fɔːtʃuːn ɪz ɔːlɹɛdi mɔː ðɐn səfɪʃənt tuː ɐtɹakt ðəʊz ʌnskɹuːpjʊləs ɐdvɛntʃəɹəz huːm ʃiː haz ɡɪvən miː ɹiːzən tuː bɪliːv ðat ʃiː pəsɪsts ɪn ɹɪɡɑːdɪŋ az an ɪntɹɪstɪŋ klas.
105066|33-000083|The large remainder of his property, therefore, doctor Sloper had divided into seven unequal parts, which he left, as endowments, to as many different hospitals and schools of medicine, in various cities of the Union.|ðə lɑːdʒ ɹɪmeɪndə ɒv hɪz pɹɒpəti, ðeəfɔː, dɒktə sləʊpə had dɪvaɪdɪd ɪntʊ sɛvən ʌniːkwəl pɑːts, wɪtʃ hiː lɛft, az ɛndaʊmənts, tuː az mɛni dɪfɹənt hɒspɪtəlz and skuːlz ɒv mɛdsən, ɪn veəɹiəs sɪtiz ɒv ðə juːniən.
105067|33-000084|To misess Penniman it seemed monstrous that a man should play such tricks with other people's money;|tuː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən ɪt siːmd mɒnstɹəs ðat eɪ man ʃʊd pleɪ sʌtʃ tɹɪks wɪð ʌðə piːpəlz mʌni;
105068|33-000085|for after his death, of course, as she said, it was other people's.|fɔː aftə hɪz dɛθ, ɒv kɔːs, az ʃiː sɛd, ɪt wɒz ʌðə piːpəlz.
105071|34-000001|it was her habit to remain in town very late in the summer;|ɪt wɒz hɜː habɪt tuː ɹɪmeɪn ɪn taʊn vɛɹi leɪt ɪn ðə sʌmə;
105072|34-000002|she preferred the house in Washington Square to any other habitation whatever, and it was under protest that she used to go to the seaside for the month of August.|ʃiː pɹɪfɜːd ðə haʊs ɪn wɒʃɪŋtən skweə tuː ɛni ʌðə habɪteɪʃən wɒtɛvə, and ɪt wɒz ʌndə pɹəʊtɛst ðat ʃiː juːzd tuː ɡəʊ tuː ðə siːsaɪd fɔː ðə mʌnθ ɒv ɔːɡəst.
105073|34-000003|At the sea she spent her month at an hotel.|at ðə siː ʃiː spɛnt hɜː mʌnθ at an həʊtɛl.
105074|34-000004|The year that her father died she intermitted this custom altogether, not thinking it consistent with deep mourning;|ðə jiə ðat hɜː fɑːðə daɪd ʃiː ɪntəmɪtɪd ðɪs kʌstəm ɔːltəɡɛðə, nɒt θɪŋkɪŋ ɪt kənsɪstənt wɪð diːp mɔːnɪŋ;
105075|34-000005|and the year after that she put off her departure till so late that the middle of August found her still in the heated solitude of Washington Square.|and ðə jiə aftə ðat ʃiː pʊt ɒf hɜː dɪpɑːtʃə tɪl səʊ leɪt ðat ðə mɪdəl ɒv ɔːɡəst faʊnd hɜː stɪl ɪn ðə hiːtɪd sɒlɪtjuːd ɒv wɒʃɪŋtən skweə.
105076|34-000006|misess Penniman, who was fond of a change, was usually eager for a visit to the country;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, huː wɒz fɒnd ɒv eɪ tʃeɪndʒ, wɒz juːʒuːəli iːɡə fɔː eɪ vɪzɪt tuː ðə kʌntɹi;
105077|34-000007|but this year she appeared quite content with such rural impressions as she could gather, at the parlour window, from the ailantus-trees behind the wooden paling.|bʌt ðɪs jiə ʃiː ɐpiəd kwaɪt kɒntɛnt wɪð sʌtʃ ɹʊəɹəl ɪmpɹɛʃənz az ʃiː kʊd ɡaðə, at ðə pɑːlə wɪndəʊ, fɹɒm ðə eɪlantʌstɹiːz bɪhaɪnd ðə wʊdən peɪlɪŋ.
105078|34-000008|The peculiar fragrance of this vegetation used to diffuse itself in the evening air, and misess Penniman, on the warm nights of July, often sat at the open window and inhaled it.|ðə pɪkjuːliə fɹeɪɡɹəns ɒv ðɪs vɛdʒɪteɪʃən juːzd tuː dɪfjuːz ɪtsɛlf ɪn ðə iːvnɪŋ eə, and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, ɒn ðə wɔːm naɪts ɒv dʒuːlaɪ, ɒfən sat at ðə əʊpən wɪndəʊ and ɪnheɪld ɪt.
105079|34-000009|This was a happy moment for misess Penniman;|ðɪs wɒz eɪ hapi məʊmənt fɔː mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən;
105080|34-000010|after the death of her brother she felt more free to obey her impulses.|aftə ðə dɛθ ɒv hɜː bɹʌðə ʃiː fɛlt mɔː fɹiː tuː əʊbeɪ hɜː ɪmpʌlsɪz.
105081|34-000011|A vague oppression had disappeared from her life, and she enjoyed a sense of freedom of which she had not been conscious since the memorable time, so long ago, when the Doctor went abroad with Catherine and left her at home to entertain Morris Townsend.|eɪ veɪɡ əpɹɛʃən had dɪsɐpiəd fɹɒm hɜː laɪf, and ʃiː ɛndʒɔɪd eɪ sɛns ɒv fɹiːdəm ɒv wɪtʃ ʃiː had nɒt biːn kɒnʃəs sɪns ðə mɛməɹəbəl taɪm, səʊ lɒŋ ɐɡəʊ, wɛn ðə dɒktə wɛnt ɐbɹɔːd wɪð kaθɹɪn and lɛft hɜː at həʊm tuː ɛntəteɪn mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
105082|34-000012|The year that had elapsed since her brother's death reminded her -- of that happy time, because, although Catherine, in growing older, had become a person to be reckoned with, yet her society was a very different thing, as misess Penniman said, from that of a tank of cold water.|ðə jiə ðat had ɪlapst sɪns hɜː bɹʌðəz dɛθ ɹɪmaɪndɪd hɜː -- ɒv ðat hapi taɪm, bɪkɒz, ɔːlðəʊ kaθɹɪn, ɪn ɡɹəʊɪŋ əʊldə, had bɪkʌm eɪ pɜːsən tuː biː ɹɪkəʊnd wɪð, jɛt hɜː səsaɪəti wɒz eɪ vɛɹi dɪfɹənt θɪŋ, az mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən sɛd, fɹɒm ðat ɒv eɪ taŋk ɒv kəʊld wɔːtə.
105083|34-000013|The elder lady hardly knew what use to make of this larger margin of her life;|ðə ɛldə leɪdi hɑːdli njuː wɒt juːs tuː meɪk ɒv ðɪs lɑːdʒə mɑːdʒɪn ɒv hɜː laɪf;
105084|34-000014|she sat and looked at it very much as she had often sat, with her poised needle in her hand, before her tapestry frame.|ʃiː sat and lʊkt at ɪt vɛɹi mʌtʃ az ʃiː had ɒfən sat, wɪð hɜː pɔɪzd niːdəl ɪn hɜː hand, bɪfɔː hɜː tapɪstɹi fɹeɪm.
105085|34-000015|She had a confident hope, however, that her rich impulses, her talent for embroidery, would still find their application, and this confidence was justified before many months had elapsed.|ʃiː had eɪ kɒnfɪdənt həʊp, haʊɛvə, ðat hɜː ɹɪtʃ ɪmpʌlsɪz, hɜː talənt fɔː ɛmbɹɔɪdəɹi, wʊd stɪl faɪnd ðeə aplɪkeɪʃən, and ðɪs kɒnfɪdəns wɒz dʒʌstɪfaɪd bɪfɔː mɛni mʌnθs had ɪlapst.
105086|34-000016|Catherine continued to live in her father's house in spite of its being represented to her that a maiden lady of quiet habits might find a more convenient abode in one of the smaller dwellings, with brown stone fronts, which had at this time begun to adorn the transverse thoroughfares in the upper part of the town.|kaθɹɪn kəntɪnjuːd tuː laɪv ɪn hɜː fɑːðəz haʊs ɪn spaɪt ɒv ɪts biːɪŋ ɹɛpɹɪzɛntɪd tuː hɜː ðat eɪ meɪdən leɪdi ɒv kwaɪət habɪts maɪt faɪnd eɪ mɔː kənviːnɪənt ɐbəʊd ɪn wɒn ɒv ðə smɔːlə dwɛlɪŋz, wɪð bɹaʊn stəʊn fɹʌnts, wɪtʃ had at ðɪs taɪm bɪɡʌn tuː ɐdɔːn ðə tɹansvɜːs θʌɹəfeəz ɪn ðə ʌpə pɑːt ɒv ðə taʊn.
105087|34-000017|She liked the earlier structure -- it had begun by this time to be called an "old" house -- and proposed to herself to end her days in it.|ʃiː laɪkt ðə ɜːlɪə stɹʌktʃə -- ɪt had bɪɡʌn baɪ ðɪs taɪm tuː biː kɔːld an "əʊld" haʊs -- and pɹəpəʊzd tuː hɜːsɛlf tuː ɛnd hɜː deɪz ɪn ɪt.
105088|34-000018|If it was too large for a pair of unpretending gentlewomen, this was better than the opposite fault;|ɪf ɪt wɒz tuː lɑːdʒ fɔː eɪ peə ɒv ʌnpɹɪtɛndɪŋ dʒɛntəlwɪmɪn, ðɪs wɒz bɛtə ðɐn ðə ɒpəzɪt fɒlt;
105089|34-000019|for Catherine had no desire to find herself in closer quarters with her aunt.|fɔː kaθɹɪn had nəʊ dɪzaɪə tuː faɪnd hɜːsɛlf ɪn kləʊsə kwɔːtəz wɪð hɜː ant.
105091|34-000021|as she had a conviction that, long as she might live, her aunt would live at least as long, and always retain her brilliancy and activity.|az ʃiː had eɪ kənvɪkʃən ðat, lɒŋ az ʃiː maɪt laɪv, hɜː ant wʊd laɪv at liːst az lɒŋ, and ɔːlweɪz ɹɪteɪn hɜː bɹɪliənsi and aktɪvɪti.
105092|34-000022|misess Penniman suggested to her the idea of a rich vitality.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən sədʒɛstɪd tuː hɜː ðə aɪdiə ɒv eɪ ɹɪtʃ vaɪtalɪti.
105093|34-000023|On one of those warm evenings in July of which mention has been made, the two ladies sat together at an open window, looking out on the quiet Square.|ɒn wɒn ɒv ðəʊz wɔːm iːvnɪŋz ɪn dʒuːlaɪ ɒv wɪtʃ mɛnʃən haz biːn meɪd, ðə tuː leɪdiz sat təɡɛðə at an əʊpən wɪndəʊ, lʊkɪŋ aʊt ɒn ðə kwaɪət skweə.
105094|34-000024|It was too hot for lighted lamps, for reading, or for work;|ɪt wɒz tuː hɒt fɔː laɪtɪd lamps, fɔː ɹiːdɪŋ, ɔː fɔː wɜːk;
105095|34-000025|it might have appeared too hot even for conversation, misess Penniman having long been speechless.|ɪt maɪt hav ɐpiəd tuː hɒt iːvən fɔː kɒnvəseɪʃən, mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən havɪŋ lɒŋ biːn spiːtʃləs.
105096|34-000026|She sat forward in the window, half on the balcony, humming a little song.|ʃiː sat fɔːwəd ɪn ðə wɪndəʊ, hɑːf ɒn ðə balkəni, hʌmɪŋ eɪ lɪtəl sɒŋ.
105097|34-000027|Catherine was within the room, in a low rocking-chair, dressed in white, and slowly using a large palmetto fan.|kaθɹɪn wɒz wɪðɪn ðə ɹuːm, ɪn eɪ ləʊ ɹɒkɪŋtʃeə, dɹɛst ɪn waɪt, and sləʊli juːzɪŋ eɪ lɑːdʒ pɑːmɛtəʊ fan.
105098|34-000028|It was in this way, at this season, that the aunt and niece, after they had had tea, habitually spent their evenings.|ɪt wɒz ɪn ðɪs weɪ, at ðɪs siːzən, ðat ðə ant and niːs, aftə ðeɪ had had tiː, hɐbɪtʃuːəli spɛnt ðeə iːvnɪŋz.
105099|34-000029|"Catherine," said misess Penniman at last, "I am going to say something that will surprise you."| "kaθɹɪn," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən at last, "aɪ am ɡəʊɪŋ tuː seɪ sʌmθɪŋ ðat wɪl səpɹaɪz juː."

105104|34-000034|If Catherine was surprised, she checked the expression of it;|ɪf kaθɹɪn wɒz səpɹaɪzd, ʃiː tʃɛkt ðə ɛkspɹɛʃən ɒv ɪt;
105105|34-000035|she gave neither a start nor an exclamation.|ʃiː ɡeɪv naɪðə eɪ stɑːt nɔː an ɛksklɐmeɪʃən.
105106|34-000036|She remained, indeed, for some moments intensely still, and this may very well have been a symptom of emotion.|ʃiː ɹɪmeɪnd, ɪndiːd, fɔː sʌm məʊmənts ɪntɛnsli stɪl, and ðɪs meɪ vɛɹi wɛl hav biːn eɪ sɪmptəm ɒv ɪməʊʃən.

105111|34-000041|"I would rather not see him," said Catherine quickly.| "aɪ wʊd ɹɑːðə nɒt siː hɪm," sɛd kaθɹɪn kwɪkli.

105119|34-000049|Catherine made no response to this, and misess Penniman went on.|kaθɹɪn meɪd nəʊ ɹɪspɒns tuː ðɪs, and mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɛnt ɒn.
105120|34-000050|I didn't know him at first;|aɪ dɪdnt nəʊ hɪm at fɜːst;

105128|34-000058|but there was a touch of sadness about him before -- especially when he went away.|bʌt ðeə wɒz eɪ tʌtʃ ɒv sadnəs ɐbaʊt hɪm bɪfɔː -- ɪspɛʃəli wɛn hiː wɛnt ɐweɪ.

105147|34-000077|I said you would be bitter indeed if you did that.|aɪ sɛd juː wʊd biː bɪtə ɪndiːd ɪf juː dɪd ðat.
105148|34-000078|Marian has the most extraordinary ideas about what happened between you;|maɹiən haz ðə məʊst ɛkstɹɔːdɪnəɹi aɪdiəz ɐbaʊt wɒt hapənd bɪtwiːn juː;
105149|34-000079|she seems to think he behaved in some very unusual manner.|ʃiː siːmz tuː θɪŋk hiː bɪheɪvd ɪn sʌm vɛɹi ʌnjuːʒuːəl manə.
105150|34-000080|I took the liberty of reminding her of the real facts, and placing the story in its true light.|aɪ tʊk ðə lɪbəti ɒv ɹɪmaɪndɪŋ hɜː ɒv ðə ɹiəl fakts, and pleɪsɪŋ ðə stɔːɹi ɪn ɪts tɹuː laɪt.
105151|34-000081|He has no bitterness, Catherine, I can assure you;|hiː haz nəʊ bɪtənəs, kaθɹɪn, aɪ kan əʃʊə juː;
105152|34-000082|and he might be excused for it, for things have not gone well with him.|and hiː maɪt biː ɛkskjuːst fɔː ɪt, fɔː θɪŋz hav nɒt ɡɒn wɛl wɪð hɪm.
105153|34-000083|He has been all over the world, and tried to establish himself everywhere;|hiː haz biːn ɔːl əʊvə ðə wɜːld, and tɹaɪd tuː ɪstablɪʃ hɪmsɛlf ɛvɹɪweə;
105154|34-000084|but his evil star was against him.|bʌt hɪz iːvəl stɑː wɒz ɐɡɛnst hɪm.
105155|34-000085|It is most interesting to hear him talk of his evil star.|ɪt ɪz məʊst ɪntɹɪstɪŋ tuː hiə hɪm tɔːk ɒv hɪz iːvəl stɑː.
105156|34-000086|Everything failed;|ɛvɹɪθɪŋ feɪld;
105158|34-000088|I believe he married some lady somewhere in Europe.|aɪ bɪliːv hiː maɹid sʌm leɪdi sʌmweə ɪn jʊəɹəp.

105161|34-000091|She died soon afterwards;|ʃiː daɪd suːn aftəwədz;

105163|34-000093|He has not been in New York for ten years;|hiː haz nɒt biːn ɪn njuː jɔːk fɔː tɛn jiəz;
105164|34-000094|he came back a few days ago.|hiː keɪm bak eɪ fjuː deɪz ɐɡəʊ.
105165|34-000095|The first thing he did was to ask me about you.|ðə fɜːst θɪŋ hiː dɪd wɒz tuː ask miː ɐbaʊt juː.
105166|34-000096|He had heard you had never married;|hiː had hɜːd juː had nɛvə maɹid;
105167|34-000097|he seemed very much interested about that.|hiː siːmd vɛɹi mʌtʃ ɪntɹɪstɪd ɐbaʊt ðat.
105168|34-000098|He said you had been the real romance of his life.|hiː sɛd juː had biːn ðə ɹiəl ɹəʊmans ɒv hɪz laɪf.
105169|34-000099|Catherine had suffered her companion to proceed from point to point, and pause to pause, without interrupting her;|kaθɹɪn had sʌfəd hɜː kəmpaniən tuː pɹəsiːd fɹɒm pɔɪnt tuː pɔɪnt, and pɔːz tuː pɔːz, wɪðaʊt ɪntəɹʌptɪŋ hɜː;
105170|34-000100|she fixed her eyes on the ground and listened.|ʃiː fɪkst hɜː aɪz ɒn ðə ɡɹaʊnd and lɪsənd.
105171|34-000101|But the last phrase I have quoted was followed by a pause of peculiar significance, and then, at last, Catherine spoke.|bʌt ðə last fɹeɪz aɪ hav kwəʊtɪd wɒz fɒləʊd baɪ eɪ pɔːz ɒv pɪkjuːliə sɪɡnɪfɪkəns, and ðɛn, at last, kaθɹɪn spəʊk.
105172|34-000102|It will be observed that before doing so she had received a good deal of information about Morris Townsend.|ɪt wɪl biː ɒbzɜːvd ðat bɪfɔː duːɪŋ səʊ ʃiː had ɹɪsiːvd eɪ ɡʊd diːl ɒv ɪnfəmeɪʃən ɐbaʊt mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.

105175|34-000105|"Doesn't it interest you?" asked misess Penniman, with a certain timorous archness.| "dʌzənt ɪt ɪntɹɪst juː?" askt mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, wɪð eɪ sɜːtən tɪməɹəs ɑːtʃnɛs.
105176|34-000106|"It pains me," said Catherine.| "ɪt peɪnz miː," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105177|34-000107|I was afraid you would say that.|aɪ wɒz ɐfɹeɪd juː wʊd seɪ ðat.
105178|34-000108|But don't you think you could get used to it?|bʌt dəʊnt juː θɪŋk juː kʊd ɡɛt juːzd tuː ɪt?
105179|34-000109|He wants so much to see you.|hiː wɒnts səʊ mʌtʃ tuː siː juː.
105180|34-000110|"Please don't, Aunt Lavinia," said Catherine, getting up from her seat.| "pliːz dəʊnt, ant lavɪniə," sɛd kaθɹɪn, ɡɛtɪŋ ʌp fɹɒm hɜː siːt.
105181|34-000111|She moved quickly away, and went to the other window, which stood open to the balcony;|ʃiː muːvd kwɪkli ɐweɪ, and wɛnt tuː ðə ʌðə wɪndəʊ, wɪtʃ stʊd əʊpən tuː ðə balkəni;
105182|34-000112|and here, in the embrasure, concealed from her aunt by the white curtains, she remained a long time, looking out into the warm darkness.|and hiə, ɪn ðə ɛmbɹaʒə, kənsiːld fɹɒm hɜː ant baɪ ðə waɪt kɜːtənz, ʃiː ɹɪmeɪnd eɪ lɒŋ taɪm, lʊkɪŋ aʊt ɪntʊ ðə wɔːm dɑːknəs.
105183|34-000113|She had had a great shock;|ʃiː had had eɪ ɡɹeɪt ʃɒk;
105184|34-000114|it was as if the gulf of the past had suddenly opened, and a spectral figure had risen out of it.|ɪt wɒz az ɪf ðə ɡʌlf ɒv ðə past had sʌdənli əʊpənd, and eɪ spɛktɹəl fɪɡə had ɹɪzən aʊt ɒv ɪt.
105185|34-000115|There were some things she believed she had got over, some feelings that she had thought of as dead;|ðeə wɜː sʌm θɪŋz ʃiː bɪliːvd ʃiː had ɡɒt əʊvə, sʌm fiːlɪŋz ðat ʃiː had θɔːt ɒv az dɛd;

105187|34-000117|misess Penniman had made them stir themselves.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had meɪd ðɛm stɜː ðɛmsɛlvz.
105188|34-000118|It was but a momentary agitation, Catherine said to herself;|ɪt wɒz bʌt eɪ məʊməntəɹi adʒɪteɪʃən, kaθɹɪn sɛd tuː hɜːsɛlf;
105189|34-000119|it would presently pass away.|ɪt wʊd pɹɛzəntli pas ɐweɪ.
105190|34-000120|She was trembling, and her heart was beating so that she could feel it;|ʃiː wɒz tɹɛmblɪŋ, and hɜː hɑːt wɒz biːtɪŋ səʊ ðat ʃiː kʊd fiːl ɪt;
105191|34-000121|but this also would subside.|bʌt ðɪs ɔːlsəʊ wʊd sʌbsaɪd.
105192|34-000122|Then, suddenly, while she waited for a return of her calmness, she burst into tears.|ðɛn, sʌdənli, waɪl ʃiː weɪtɪd fɔː eɪ ɹɪtɜːn ɒv hɜː kɑːmnəs, ʃiː bɜːst ɪntʊ tiəz.
105193|34-000123|But her tears flowed very silently, so that misess Penniman had no observation of them.|bʌt hɜː tiəz fləʊd vɛɹi saɪləntli, səʊ ðat mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən had nəʊ ɒbzəveɪʃən ɒv ðɛm.
105194|35-000001|her refreshed attention to this gentleman had not those limits of which Catherine desired, for herself, to be conscious;|hɜː ɹɪfɹɛʃt ɐtɛnʃən tuː ðɪs dʒɛntəlmən had nɒt ðəʊz lɪmɪts ɒv wɪtʃ kaθɹɪn dɪzaɪəd, fɔː hɜːsɛlf, tuː biː kɒnʃəs;
105195|35-000002|it lasted long enough to enable her to wait another week before speaking of him again.|ɪt lastɪd lɒŋ ɪnʌf tuː ɛneɪbəl hɜː tuː weɪt ɐnʌðə wiːk bɪfɔː spiːkɪŋ ɒv hɪm ɐɡɛn.
105196|35-000003|It was under the same circumstances that she once more attacked the subject.|ɪt wɒz ʌndə ðə seɪm sɜːkəmstansɪz ðat ʃiː wʌns mɔː ɐtakt ðə sʌbdʒɛkt.
105197|35-000004|She had been sitting with her niece in the evening;|ʃiː had biːn sɪtɪŋ wɪð hɜː niːs ɪn ðə iːvnɪŋ;
105198|35-000005|only on this occasion, as the night was not so warm, the lamp had been lighted, and Catherine had placed herself near it with a morsel of fancy-work.|əʊnli ɒn ðɪs əkeɪʒən, az ðə naɪt wɒz nɒt səʊ wɔːm, ðə lamp had biːn laɪtɪd, and kaθɹɪn had pleɪst hɜːsɛlf niə ɪt wɪð eɪ mɔːsəl ɒv fansiwɜːk.
105199|35-000006|misess Penniman went and sat alone for half an hour on the balcony;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɛnt and sat ɐləʊn fɔː hɑːf an aʊə ɒn ðə balkəni;

105201|35-000008|At last she sank into a seat near Catherine, with clasped hands, and a little look of excitement.|at last ʃiː saŋk ɪntʊ eɪ siːt niə kaθɹɪn, wɪð klaspt handz, and eɪ lɪtəl lʊk ɒv ɛksaɪtmənt.
105202|35-000009|"Shall you be angry if I speak to you again about him?" she asked.| "ʃal juː biː aŋɡɹi ɪf aɪ spiːk tuː juː ɐɡɛn ɐbaʊt hɪm?" ʃiː askt.
105203|35-000010|Catherine looked up at her quietly.|kaθɹɪn lʊkt ʌp at hɜː kwaɪətli.

105207|35-000014|"He sent you a message," said misess Penniman.| "hiː sɛnt juː eɪ mɛsɪdʒ," sɛd mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən.

105209|35-000016|In all these years Catherine had had time to forget how little she had to thank her aunt for in the season of her misery;|ɪn ɔːl ðiːz jiəz kaθɹɪn had had taɪm tuː fəɡɛt haʊ lɪtəl ʃiː had tuː θaŋk hɜː ant fɔː ɪn ðə siːzən ɒv hɜː mɪzəɹi;
105210|35-000017|she had long ago forgiven misess Penniman for taking too much upon herself.|ʃiː had lɒŋ ɐɡəʊ fəɡɪvən mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən fɔː teɪkɪŋ tuː mʌtʃ əpɒn hɜːsɛlf.

105215|35-000022|misess Penniman, however, with her high conception of the sanctity of pledges, carried her point.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən, haʊɛvə, wɪð hɜː haɪ kənsɛpʃən ɒv ðə saŋktɪti ɒv plɛdʒɪz, kaɹid hɜː pɔɪnt.

105232|35-000039|He wishes to justify himself;|hiː wɪʃɪz tuː dʒʌstɪfaɪ hɪmsɛlf;

105235|35-000042|Catherine listened to this wonderful speech without pausing in her work;|kaθɹɪn lɪsənd tuː ðɪs wʌndəfəl spiːtʃ wɪðaʊt pɔːzɪŋ ɪn hɜː wɜːk;
105236|35-000043|she had now had several days to accustom herself to think of Morris Townsend again as an actuality.|ʃiː had naʊ had sɛvɹəl deɪz tuː ɐkʌstəm hɜːsɛlf tuː θɪŋk ɒv mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd ɐɡɛn az an aktʃuːalɪti.
105237|35-000044|When it was over she said simply, "Please say to mister Townsend that I wish he would leave me alone."|wɛn ɪt wɒz əʊvə ʃiː sɛd sɪmpli, "pliːz seɪ tuː mɪstə taʊnsɛnd ðat aɪ wɪʃ hiː wʊd liːv miː ɐləʊn."
105238|35-000045|She had hardly spoken when a sharp, firm ring at the door vibrated through the summer night.|ʃiː had hɑːdli spəʊkən wɛn eɪ ʃɑːp, fɜːm ɹɪŋ at ðə dɔː vaɪbɹeɪtɪd θɹuː ðə sʌmə naɪt.
105239|35-000046|Catherine looked up at the clock;|kaθɹɪn lʊkt ʌp at ðə klɒk;

105241|35-000048|misess Penniman at the same moment gave a little start, and then Catherine's eyes turned quickly to her aunt.|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən at ðə seɪm məʊmənt ɡeɪv eɪ lɪtəl stɑːt, and ðɛn kaθɹɪnz aɪz tɜːnd kwɪkli tuː hɜː ant.

105243|35-000050|misess Penniman was blushing;|mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən wɒz blʌʃɪŋ;

105245|35-000052|it seemed to confess something.|ɪt siːmd tuː kənfɛs sʌmθɪŋ.
105246|35-000053|Catherine guessed its meaning, and rose quickly from her chair.|kaθɹɪn ɡɛst ɪts miːnɪŋ, and ɹəʊz kwɪkli fɹɒm hɜː tʃeə.
105247|35-000054|"Aunt Penniman," she said, in a tone that scared her companion, "have you taken the liberty ...?"| "ant pɛnɪmən," ʃiː sɛd, ɪn eɪ təʊn ðat skeəd hɜː kəmpaniən, "hav juː teɪkən ðə lɪbəti ...?"

105249|35-000056|Catherine had frightened her aunt, but she was also frightened herself;|kaθɹɪn had fɹaɪtənd hɜː ant, bʌt ʃiː wɒz ɔːlsəʊ fɹaɪtənd hɜːsɛlf;
105250|35-000057|she was on the point of rushing to give orders to the servant, who was passing to the door, to admit no one;|ʃiː wɒz ɒn ðə pɔɪnt ɒv ɹʌʃɪŋ tuː ɡɪv ɔːdəz tuː ðə sɜːvənt, huː wɒz pasɪŋ tuː ðə dɔː, tuː ɐdmɪt nəʊ wɒn;

105258|35-000065|He was forty-five years old, and his figure was not that of the straight, slim young man she remembered.|hiː wɒz fɔːtɪfaɪv jiəz əʊld, and hɪz fɪɡə wɒz nɒt ðat ɒv ðə stɹeɪt, slɪm jʌŋ man ʃiː ɹɪmɛmbəd.
105259|35-000066|But it was a very fine person, and a fair and lustrous beard, spreading itself upon a well-presented chest, contributed to its effect.|bʌt ɪt wɒz eɪ vɛɹi faɪn pɜːsən, and eɪ feə and lʌstɹəs biəd, spɹɛdɪŋ ɪtsɛlf əpɒn eɪ wɛlpɹɪzəntɪd tʃɛst, kəntɹɪbjuːtɪd tuː ɪts ɪfɛkt.
105260|35-000067|After a moment Catherine recognised the upper half of the face, which, though her visitor's clustering locks had grown thin, was still remarkably handsome.|aftə eɪ məʊmənt kaθɹɪn ɹɛkəɡnaɪzd ðə ʌpə hɑːf ɒv ðə feɪs, wɪtʃ, ðəʊ hɜː vɪzɪtəz klʌstəɹɪŋ lɒks had ɡɹəʊn θɪn, wɒz stɪl ɹɪmɑːkəbli handsʌm.
105261|35-000068|He stood in a deeply deferential attitude, with his eyes on her face.|hiː stʊd ɪn eɪ diːpli dɛfəɹɛnʃəl atɪtjuːd, wɪð hɪz aɪz ɒn hɜː feɪs.
105262|35-000069|"I have ventured -- I have ventured," he said;| "aɪ hav vɛntʃəd -- aɪ hav vɛntʃəd," hiː sɛd;
105263|35-000070|and then he paused, looking about him, as if he expected her to ask him to sit down.|and ðɛn hiː pɔːzd, lʊkɪŋ ɐbaʊt hɪm, az ɪf hiː ɛkspɛktɪd hɜː tuː ask hɪm tuː sɪt daʊn.
105265|35-000072|Catherine, for a minute, was conscious of a distinct determination not to invite him to take a seat.|kaθɹɪn, fɔː eɪ mɪnɪt, wɒz kɒnʃəs ɒv eɪ dɪstɪŋkt dɪtɜːmɪneɪʃən nɒt tuː ɪnvaɪt hɪm tuː teɪk eɪ siːt.
105266|35-000073|Why had he come?|waɪ had hiː kʌm?
105267|35-000074|It was wrong for him to come.|ɪt wɒz ɹɒŋ fɔː hɪm tuː kʌm.
105268|35-000075|Morris was embarrassed, but Catherine gave him no help.|mɒɹɪs wɒz ɛmbaɹəst, bʌt kaθɹɪn ɡeɪv hɪm nəʊ hɛlp.
105269|35-000076|It was not that she was glad of his embarrassment;|ɪt wɒz nɒt ðat ʃiː wɒz ɡlad ɒv hɪz ɛmbaɹəsmənt;
105270|35-000077|on the contrary, it excited all her own liabilities of this kind, and gave her great pain.|ɒn ðə kɒntɹəɹi, ɪt ɛksaɪtɪd ɔːl hɜː əʊn laɪəbɪlɪtiz ɒv ðɪs kaɪnd, and ɡeɪv hɜː ɡɹeɪt peɪn.
105271|35-000078|But how could she welcome him when she felt so vividly that he ought not to have come?|bʌt haʊ kʊd ʃiː wɛlkʌm hɪm wɛn ʃiː fɛlt səʊ vɪvɪdli ðat hiː ɔːt nɒt tuː hav kʌm?
105273|35-000080|But he stopped again;|bʌt hiː stɒpt ɐɡɛn;
105274|35-000081|it was not easy.|ɪt wɒz nɒt iːzi.
105275|35-000082|Catherine still said nothing, and he may well have recalled with apprehension her ancient faculty of silence.|kaθɹɪn stɪl sɛd nʌθɪŋ, and hiː meɪ wɛl hav ɹɪkɔːld wɪð apɹɪhɛnʃən hɜː eɪnʃənt fakəlti ɒv saɪləns.
105276|35-000083|She continued to look at him, however, and as she did so she made the strangest observation.|ʃiː kəntɪnjuːd tuː lʊk at hɪm, haʊɛvə, and az ʃiː dɪd səʊ ʃiː meɪd ðə stɹeɪndʒɪst ɒbzəveɪʃən.
105280|35-000087|She had lived on something that was connected with him, and she had consumed it in doing so.|ʃiː had lɪvd ɒn sʌmθɪŋ ðat wɒz kənɛktɪd wɪð hɪm, and ʃiː had kənsjuːmd ɪt ɪn duːɪŋ səʊ.
105281|35-000088|This person did not look unhappy.|ðɪs pɜːsən dɪd nɒt lʊk ʌnhapi.
105282|35-000089|He was fair and well-preserved, perfectly dressed, mature and complete.|hiː wɒz feə and wɛlpɹɪsɜːvd, pɜːfɛktlɪ dɹɛst, mətʃʊə and kəmpliːt.
105283|35-000090|As Catherine looked at him, the story of his life defined itself in his eyes;|az kaθɹɪn lʊkt at hɪm, ðə stɔːɹi ɒv hɪz laɪf dɪfaɪnd ɪtsɛlf ɪn hɪz aɪz;
105284|35-000091|he had made himself comfortable, and he had never been caught.|hiː had meɪd hɪmsɛlf kʌmftəbəl, and hiː had nɛvə biːn kɔːt.
105285|35-000092|But even while her perception opened itself to this, she had no desire to catch him;|bʌt iːvən waɪl hɜː pəsɛpʃən əʊpənd ɪtsɛlf tuː ðɪs, ʃiː had nəʊ dɪzaɪə tuː katʃ hɪm;
105286|35-000093|his presence was painful to her, and she only wished he would go.|hɪz pɹɛzəns wɒz peɪnfəl tuː hɜː, and ʃiː əʊnli wɪʃt hiː wʊd ɡəʊ.
105287|35-000094|"Will you not sit down?" he asked.| "wɪl juː nɒt sɪt daʊn?" hiː askt.
105288|35-000095|"I think we had better not," said Catherine.| "aɪ θɪŋk wiː had bɛtə nɒt," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105289|35-000096|"I offend you by coming?" He was very grave;| "aɪ əfɛnd juː baɪ kʌmɪŋ?" hiː wɒz vɛɹi ɡɹeɪv;
105290|35-000097|he spoke in a tone of the richest respect.|hiː spəʊk ɪn eɪ təʊn ɒv ðə ɹɪtʃɪst ɹɪspɛkt.
105291|35-000098|I don't think you ought to have come.|aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk juː ɔːt tuː hav kʌm.
105292|35-000099|Did not misess Penniman tell you -- did she not give you my message?|dɪd nɒt mɪsɛs pɛnɪmən tɛl juː -- dɪd ʃiː nɒt ɡɪv juː maɪ mɛsɪdʒ?
105293|35-000100|She told me something, but I did not understand.|ʃiː təʊld miː sʌmθɪŋ, bʌt aɪ dɪd nɒt ʌndəstand.
105294|35-000101|I wish you would let me tell you -- let me speak for myself.|aɪ wɪʃ juː wʊd lɛt miː tɛl juː -- lɛt miː spiːk fɔː maɪsɛlf.
105295|35-000102|"I don't think it is necessary," said Catherine.| "aɪ dəʊnt θɪŋk ɪt ɪz nɛsɪsəɹi," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105296|35-000103|Not for you, perhaps, but for me.|nɒt fɔː juː, pəhaps, bʌt fɔː miː.
105297|35-000104|It would be a great satisfaction -- and I have not many.|ɪt wʊd biː eɪ ɡɹeɪt satɪsfakʃən -- and aɪ hav nɒt mɛni.
105298|35-000105|He seemed to be coming nearer;|hiː siːmd tuː biː kʌmɪŋ niəɹə;
105299|35-000106|Catherine turned away.|kaθɹɪn tɜːnd ɐweɪ.
105300|35-000107|"Can we not be friends again?" he said.| "kan wiː nɒt biː fɹɛndz ɐɡɛn?" hiː sɛd.
105301|35-000108|"We are not enemies," said Catherine.| "wiː ɑː nɒt ɛnəmiz," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105302|35-000109|I have none but friendly feelings to you.|aɪ hav nʌn bʌt fɹɛndli fiːlɪŋz tuː juː.
105303|35-000110|Ah, I wonder whether you know the happiness it gives me to hear you say that!|ɑː, aɪ wʌndə wɛðə juː nəʊ ðə hapɪnəs ɪt ɡɪvz miː tuː hiə juː seɪ ðat!
105304|35-000111|Catherine uttered no intimation that she measured the influence of her words;|kaθɹɪn ʌtəd nəʊ ɪntɪmeɪʃən ðat ʃiː mɛʒəd ðə ɪnfluːəns ɒv hɜː wɜːdz;
105305|35-000112|and he presently went on, "You have not changed -- the years have passed happily for you."|and hiː pɹɛzəntli wɛnt ɒn, "juː hav nɒt tʃeɪndʒd -- ðə jiəz hav past hapɪli fɔː juː."
105306|35-000113|"They have passed very quietly," said Catherine.| "ðeɪ hav past vɛɹi kwaɪətli," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105307|35-000114|They have left no marks;|ðeɪ hav lɛft nəʊ mɑːks;
105308|35-000115|you are admirably young.|juː ɑː admɪɹəbli jʌŋ.
105309|35-000116|This time he succeeded in coming nearer -- he was close to her;|ðɪs taɪm hiː səksiːdɪd ɪn kʌmɪŋ niəɹə -- hiː wɒz kləʊs tuː hɜː;
105310|35-000117|she saw his glossy perfumed beard, and his eyes above it looking strange and hard.|ʃiː sɔː hɪz ɡlɒsi pɜːfjuːmd biəd, and hɪz aɪz əbʌv ɪt lʊkɪŋ stɹeɪndʒ and hɑːd.
105311|35-000118|It was very different from his old -- from his young -- face.|ɪt wɒz vɛɹi dɪfɹənt fɹɒm hɪz əʊld -- fɹɒm hɪz jʌŋ -- feɪs.
105312|35-000119|If she had first seen him this way she would not have liked him.|ɪf ʃiː had fɜːst siːn hɪm ðɪs weɪ ʃiː wʊd nɒt hav laɪkt hɪm.
105313|35-000120|It seemed to her that he was smiling, or trying to smile.|ɪt siːmd tuː hɜː ðat hiː wɒz smaɪlɪŋ, ɔː tɹaɪɪŋ tuː smaɪl.
105314|35-000121|"Catherine," he said, lowering his voice, "I have never ceased to think of you."| "kaθɹɪn," hiː sɛd, ləʊəɹɪŋ hɪz vɔɪs, "aɪ hav nɛvə siːst tuː θɪŋk ɒv juː."
105315|35-000122|"Please don't say those things," she answered.| "pliːz dəʊnt seɪ ðəʊz θɪŋz," ʃiː ansəd.
105316|35-000123|Do you hate me?|duː juː heɪt miː?
105317|35-000124|"Oh no," said Catherine.| "əʊ nəʊ," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105318|35-000125|Something in her tone discouraged him, but in a moment he recovered himself.|sʌmθɪŋ ɪn hɜː təʊn dɪskʌɹɪdʒd hɪm, bʌt ɪn eɪ məʊmənt hiː ɹɪkʌvəd hɪmsɛlf.
105319|35-000126|Have you still some kindness for me, then?|hav juː stɪl sʌm kaɪndnəs fɔː miː, ðɛn?
105320|35-000127|"I don't know why you have come here to ask me such things!" Catherine exclaimed.| "aɪ dəʊnt nəʊ waɪ juː hav kʌm hiə tuː ask miː sʌtʃ θɪŋz!" kaθɹɪn ɛkskleɪmd.
105322|35-000129|That is impossible.|ðat ɪz ɪmpɒsɪbəl.

105325|35-000132|"I will not allow it!" said Catherine.| "aɪ wɪl nɒt ɐlaʊ ɪt!" sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105326|35-000133|He looked at her again in silence.|hiː lʊkt at hɜː ɐɡɛn ɪn saɪləns.

105331|35-000138|"Please don't come again," she said.| "pliːz dəʊnt kʌm ɐɡɛn," ʃiː sɛd.
105333|35-000140|She made a great effort;|ʃiː meɪd eɪ ɡɹeɪt ɛfət;
105334|35-000141|she wished to say something that would make it impossible he should ever again cross her threshold.|ʃiː wɪʃt tuː seɪ sʌmθɪŋ ðat wʊd meɪk ɪt ɪmpɒsɪbəl hiː ʃʊd ɛvə ɐɡɛn kɹɒs hɜː θɹɛʃəʊld.
105335|35-000142|It is wrong of you.|ɪt ɪz ɹɒŋ ɒv juː.
105336|35-000143|There is no propriety in it -- no reason for it.|ðeə ɪz nəʊ pɹəpɹaɪətɪ ɪn ɪt -- nəʊ ɹiːzən fɔː ɪt.
105337|35-000144|"Ah, dearest lady, you do me injustice!" cried Morris Townsend.| "ɑː, diəɹɪst leɪdi, juː duː miː ɪndʒʌstɪs!" kɹaɪd mɒɹɪs taʊnsɛnd.
105338|35-000145|We have only waited, and now we are free.|wiː hav əʊnli weɪtɪd, and naʊ wiː ɑː fɹiː.
105339|35-000146|"You treated me badly," said Catherine.| "juː tɹiːtɪd miː badli," sɛd kaθɹɪn.
105340|35-000147|Not if you think of it rightly.|nɒt ɪf juː θɪŋk ɒv ɪt ɹaɪtli.

105343|35-000150|Morris felt it to be a considerable damage to his cause that he could not add that she had had something more besides;|mɒɹɪs fɛlt ɪt tuː biː eɪ kənsɪdəɹəbəl damɪdʒ tuː hɪz kɔːz ðat hiː kʊd nɒt ad ðat ʃiː had had sʌmθɪŋ mɔː bɪsaɪdz;

105348|35-000155|Then he added, with a deeper tenderness, "Catherine, have you never forgiven me?"|ðɛn hiː adɪd, wɪð eɪ diːpə tɛndənəs, "kaθɹɪn, hav juː nɛvə fəɡɪvən miː?"
105349|35-000156|I forgave you years ago, but it is useless for us to attempt to be friends.|aɪ fəɡeɪv juː jiəz ɐɡəʊ, bʌt ɪt ɪz juːsləs fɔː ʌs tuː ɐtɛmpt tuː biː fɹɛndz.

105353|35-000160|You treated me too badly.|juː tɹiːtɪd miː tuː badli.
105354|35-000161|I felt it very much;|aɪ fɛlt ɪt vɛɹi mʌtʃ;
105355|35-000162|I felt it for years.|aɪ fɛlt ɪt fɔː jiəz.
105356|35-000163|And then she went on, with her wish to show him that he must not come to her this way, "I can't begin again -- I can't take it up."|and ðɛn ʃiː wɛnt ɒn, wɪð hɜː wɪʃ tuː ʃəʊ hɪm ðat hiː mʌst nɒt kʌm tuː hɜː ðɪs weɪ, "aɪ kant bɪɡɪn ɐɡɛn -- aɪ kant teɪk ɪt ʌp."

105358|35-000165|It was too serious;|ɪt wɒz tuː siəɹiəs;

105375|35-000182|Morris looked vaguely round him, and gave a deep sigh.|mɒɹɪs lʊkt veɪɡli ɹaʊnd hɪm, and ɡeɪv eɪ diːp saɪ.
